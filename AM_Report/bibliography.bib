These parametric solutions are precomputed off-line and stored in memory in the form of a computational vademecum so that they can be used on-line with negligible cost. This renders a more efficient computational method than traditional finite element methods at performing simulations of processes. One key issue of the proposed method is the efficient computation of the parametric enrichments. These are computed and efficiently stored in memory by employing proper generalized decompositions. Although the presented method can be broadly applied, it is particularly well suited in manufacturing processes involving localized physics that depend on many parameters, such as welding. After introducing the vademecum-generalized finite element method formulation, we present some numerical examples related to the simulation of thermal models encountered in welding processes.

  title = {Reduced-basis based {{S-FEM}} and {{G-FEM}} for the efficient simulation of processes involving moving heat sources},
  abstract = {The numerical simulation of manufacturing processes involving moving heat sources such as welding
or surface treatments are of great interest in industry. It allows reducing the design cycle time and
optimizing the process without the need of costly and time consuming test campaigns.
Using traditional finite element methods (FEM) to simulate these processes may lead to solve
systems of an enormous number of degrees of freedom with a high computational cost. This fact has
motivated the research for more efficient solutions to address these problems in recent years,
focusing on one key idea: the large temperature gradients are confined to a relatively small area, near
the heat source, compared to the size of the piece (heat affected zone, HAZ). Thus, simulations with
a local/global approach [1] or a refinement moving mesh technique [2] can be found in the literature.
The latter strategy is implemented in the widely used commercial code SYSWELD.
This paper explores various strategies to increase the efficiency of these simulations using three basic
ingredients: superposition, solution enrichment and reduced-basis. The feasibility of a coupled
formulation between FE and reduced-basis was previously studied in [3-4]. The general scheme of
the proposed procedure is as follows. First, a background coarse FE discretization is established
along the entire piece. Then, a patch that moves with the heat source is superimposed, covering the
HAZ area. At this point, several possibilities can be considered. One option is to introduce a very fine
FE discretization, resulting in the so-called s-version of the FEM [5] (FEM-FEM approach). Another
choice can be to construct a moving reduced-basis in the patch using information from experiments
or previous simulations (FEM-POD approach). Finally, a Generalized Finite Element (G-FEM)
approach can be followed considering an enriched interpolant on the patch area thanks to the
partition of unity property [6]. These three strategies are compared in terms of robustness and
computational cost.},

We show that the p-version of our GFEM is capable of achieving very high accuracy for multiscale problems which may be impossible to solve using the standard FEM. We analyse the effect of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the method namely: (a) The data and the buffer included in the handbook domains, and (b) The accuracy of the numerical construction of the handbook functions. We illustrate the robustness of the method by employing as model problem the Laplacian in a domain with a large number of closely spaced voids. Similar robustness can be expected for problems of heat-conduction and elasticity set in domains with a large number of closely spaced voids, cracks, inclusions, etc. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The work is done with finite differences, large motion Lagrangian mechanics, and an eye towards creating a model in which complex rigid body dynamics can be incorporated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We then review the many advantages of embedded mesh techniques for interface representation, and investigate a completely finite element based strategy for embedding domains.  The work is seen as a precursor to robust multi-physics simulation capabilities.  Special attention must be given to these techniques in terms of stable and convergent representation of surface fluxes.  Mesh locking and over-constraint are particularly addressed.   We show that traditional methods for enforcing continuity at embedded interfaces cannot adequately guarantee flux stability, and show a less traditional method, known as Nitsche's method, to be a stable alternative.  We address the open problem of applying Nitsche's method to non-linear analysis by drawing parallels between the embedded mesh and discontinuous Galerkin ({DG}) methods, and propose a {DG} style approach to Nitsche's method.  We conclude with stable interfacial fluxes for a continuity constraint for a case of embedded finite element meshes in large deformation elasticity.  The general conclusion is drawn that stability must be addressed in the choice of interface treatment in computational mechanics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The finite cell method ({FCM}) combines the fictitious domain approach with the p-version of the finite element method and adaptive integration. For problems of linear elasticity, it offers high convergence rates and simple mesh generation, irrespective of the geometric complexity involved. This article presents the integration of the {FCM} into the framework of nonlinear finite element technology. However, the penalty parameter of the fictitious domain is restricted to a few orders of magnitude in order to maintain local uniqueness of the deformation map. As a consequence of the weak penalization, nonlinear strain measures provoke excessive stress oscillations in the cells cut by geometric boundaries, leading to a low algebraic rate of convergence. Therefore, the {FCM} approach is complemented by a local overlay of linear hierarchical basis functions in the sense of the hp-d method, which synergetically uses the h-adaptivity of the integration scheme. Numerical experiments show that the hp-d overlay effectively reduces oscillations and permits stronger penalization of the fictitious domain by stabilizing the deformation map. The hp-d-adaptive {FCM} is thus able to restore high convergence rates for the geometrically nonlinear case, while preserving the easy meshing property of the original {FCM}. Accuracy and performance of the present scheme are demonstrated by several benchmark problems in one, two, and three dimensions and the nonlinear simulation of a complex foam sample.

Synthetic bone substitute materials have to be biocompatible, biodegradable, osteoconductive and processable into macroporous scaffolds tailored to the patient specific defect. Hydroxyapatite ({HA}) and tricalcium phosphate ({TCP}) as well as mixtures of both phases, biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics ({BCP}), meet all these requirements and are considered to be optimal synthetic bone substitute materials. Rapid prototyping ({RP}) can be applied to manufacture scaffolds, meeting the criteria required to ensure bone ingrowth such as high porosity and defined pore characteristics. Such scaffolds can be used for bone tissue engineering ({BTE}), a concept based on the cultivation of osteogenic cells on osteoconductive scaffolds. In this study, scaffolds with interconnecting macroporosity were manufactured from {HA}, {TCP} and {BCP} (60 wt\% {HA}) using an indirect rapid prototyping technique involving wax ink-jet printing. {ST}-2 bone marrow stromal cells ({BMSCs}) were seeded onto the scaffolds and cultivated for 17 days under either static or dynamic culture conditions and osteogenic stimulation. While cell number within the scaffold pore system decreased in case of static conditions, dynamic cultivation allowed homogeneous cell growth even within deep pores of large (1,440 mm(3)) scaffolds. Osteogenic cell differentiation was most advanced on {BCP} scaffolds in both culture systems, while cells cultured under perfusion conditions were generally more differentiated after 17 days. Therefore, scaffolds manufactured from {BCP} ceramic and seeded with {BMSCs} using a dynamic culture system are the method of choice for bone tissue engineering.},

	shorttitle = {Isogeometric analysis},
	abstract = {Isogeometric analysis ({IGA}) represents a recently developed technology in computational mechanics that offers the possibility of integrating methods for analysis and Computer Aided Design ({CAD}) into a single, unified process. The implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains in efficiency. The tight coupling of {CAD} and analysis within {IGA} requires knowledge from both fields and it is one of the goals of the present paper to outline much of the commonly used notation. In this manuscript, through a clear and simple Matlab implementation, we present an introduction to {IGA} applied to the Finite Element ({FE}) method and related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implemen- tation of the extended {IGA} which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method ({PUM}) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. The open source Matlab code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The Bezier extraction concept that allows {FE} analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated. The article includes a summary of recent trends and developments within the field of {IGA}.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the mortar method has proven to be an effective spatial discretization strategy for large deformation contact problems, particularly when such problems feature deformable-to-deformable contact. The mortar approach has been shown to greatly enhance both the spatial accuracy and the robustness with which such problems can be solved in many circumstances. In this work, we concern ourselves with problems that arise in the context of many practical applications, both in manufacturing and in other areas. Specifically, it is frequently necessary to remesh a problem in the midst of an ongoing incremental loading strategy, either because of adaptive mesh refinement being used to improve resolution, or excessive mesh distortion which necessitates an overall remeshing. This work focuses on a particularly important issue associated with contact remeshing; i.e., the remapping of contact variables after the remesh so that a simulation can successfully continue. We develop and demonstrate our algorithm in the context of a mortar-discretized approach to contact. The approach is applicable to either two or three dimensional analysis, and is demonstrated by a number of three dimensional numerical examples.},

A non-linear finite element analysis has shown that small loads compressing the spine, not greater than those occurring in everyday life, cause loss of stability of an intervertebral disc, resulting in lateral dislocation of its nucleus pulposus. This could be a potential cause of discopathy. The model indicates that conservative therapy of herniated disc by the traction method may result in retraction of hernia by about 40 per cent.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new method to triangulate planar, curved domains that transforms a specific collection of triangles in a background mesh to conform to the boundary. In the process, no new vertices are introduced, and connectivities of triangles are left unaltered. The method relies on a novel way of parameterizing an immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its closest point projection. To guarantee its robustness, we require that the domain be C2-regular, the background mesh be sufficiently refined near the boundary, and that specific angles in triangles near the boundary be strictly acute. The method can render both straight-edged and curvilinear triangulations for the immersed domain. The latter includes curved triangles that conform exactly to the immersed boundary, and ones constructed with isoparametric mappings to interpolate the boundary at select points. High-order finite elements constructed over these curved triangles achieve optimal accuracy, which has customarily proven difficult in numerical schemes that adopt nonconforming meshes. Aside from serving as a quick and simple tool for meshing planar curved domains with complex shapes, the method provides significant advantages for simulating problems with moving boundaries and in numerical schemes that require iterating over the geometry of domains. With no conformity requirements, the same background mesh can be adopted to triangulate a large family of domains immersed in it, including ones realized over several upyears during the coarse of simulating problems with moving boundaries. We term such a background mesh as a universal mesh for the family of domains it can be used to triangulate. Universal meshes hence facilitate a framework for finite element calculations over evolving domains while using only fixed background meshes. Furthermore, because the evolving geometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be computed with high-order accuracy. We present demonstrative examples using universal meshes to simulate the interaction of rigid bodies with Stokesian fluids. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This approach is already applied to 2-dimensional linear isotropic plane stress problems in the frameworks of standard and enriched Finite Element Methods. Here it is extended to include two recently devel- oped concepts, in order to support an efficient interaction between geomet- rical models and finite element analysis namely, Isogeometric analysis and Finite Cell Method. The coupling of these concepts are tested on problems, where matching, non-matching, non-conforming and overlapping grids occur. Weakly impos- ing interface constraints in the frameworks of Isogeometric analysis and Fi- nite Cell Method is observed to be stable and consistent as the previous discretization methods.},

	abstract = {Methods for constructing arbitrary discontinuities within spectral finite elements are described and studied. We use the concept of the {eXtended} Finite Element Method ({XFEM}), which introduces the discontinuity through a local partition of unity, so there is no requirement for the mesh to be aligned with the discontinuities. A key aspect of the implementation of this method is the treatment of the blending elements adjacent to the local partition of unity. We found that a partition constructed from spectral functions one order lower than the continuous approximation is optimal and no special treatment is needed for higher order elements. For the quadrature of the Galerkin weak form, since the integrand is discontinuous, we use a strategy of subdividing the discontinuous elements into 6- and 10-node triangles; the order of the element depends on the order of the spectral method for curved discontinuities. Several numerical examples are solved to examine the accuracy of the methods. For straight discontinuities, we achieved the optimal convergence rate of the spectral element. For the curved discontinuity, the convergence rate in the energy norm error is suboptimal. We attribute the suboptimality to the approximations in the quadrature scheme. We also found that modification of the adjacent elements is only needed for lower order spectral elements.},

On this basis, we show that isogeometric collocation has the potential to increase the computational efficiency of isogeometric analysis and to outperform both isogeometric Galerkin and standard C 0 finite element methods, when a specified level of accuracy is to be achieved with minimum computational cost. We then explore an adaptive isogeometric collocation method that is based on local hierarchical refinement of {NURBS} basis functions and collocation points derived from the corresponding multi-level Greville abscissae. We introduce the concept of weighted collocation that can be consistently developed from the weighted residual form and the two-scale relation of B-splines. Using weighted collocation in the transition regions between hierarchical levels, we are able to reliably handle coincident collocation points that naturally occur for multi-level Greville abscissae. The resulting method combines the favorable properties of isogeometric collocation and hierarchical refinement in terms of computational efficiency, local adaptivity, robustness and straightforward implementation, which we illustrate by numerical examples in one, two and three dimensions.},

This approach allows the use of regular grids and therefore of fast specialized solvers for problems on complicated geometries; the resulting saddle-point system can be solved by an Uzawa/conjugate gradient algorithm. In the case of two-dimensional problems, a quasi-optimal preconditioner has been found by Fourier analysis and numerical experiments confirm its nice scaling properties. The resulting methodology is applied to a nonlinear time dependent problem, namely the flow of a viscous-plastic medium in a cylindrical pipe showing the potential of this methodology for some classes of nonlinear problems.},

	abstract = {Simulating viscoelastic solids undergoing large, nonlinear defor- mations in close contact is challenging. In addition to inter-object contact, methods relying on Lagrangian discretizations must handle degenerate cases by explicitly remeshing or resampling the object. Eulerian methods, which discretize space itself, provide an interest- ing alternative due to the fixed nature of the discretization. In this paper we present a new Eulerian method for viscoelastic materi- als that features a collision detection and resolution scheme which does not require explicit surface tracking to achieve accurate col- lision response. Time-stepping with contact is performed by the efficient solution of large sparse quadratic programs; this avoids constraint sticking and other difficulties. Simulation and collision processing can share the same uniform grid, making the algorithm easy to parallelize. We demonstrate an implementation of all the steps of the algorithm on the {GPU}. The method is effective for sim- ulation of complicated contact scenarios involving multiple highly deformable objects, and can directly simulate volumetric models obtained from medical imaging techniques such as {CT} and {MRI}.},

	shorttitle = {Use of micro-{CT}-based finite element analysis to accurately quantify peri-implant bone strains},
	abstract = {Although research has been addressed at investigating the effect of specific loading regimes on bone response around the implant, a precise quantitative understanding of the local mechanical response close to the implant site is still lacking. This study was aimed at validating micro-{CT}-based finite element (μ{FE}) models to assess tissue strains after implant placement in a rat tibia. Small implants were inserted at the medio-proximal site of 8 rat tibiae. The limbs were subjected to axial compression loading; strain close to the implant was measured by means of strain gauges. Specimen-specific μ{FE} models were created and analyzed. For each specimen, 4 different models were created corresponding to different representations of the bone–implant interface: bone and implant were assumed fully osseointegrated (A); a low stiffness interface zone was assumed with thickness of 40 μm (B), 80 μm (C), and 160 μm (D). In all cases, measured and computational strains correlated highly (R 2 = 0.95, 0.92, 0.93, and 0.95 in A, B, C, and D, respectively). The averaged calculated strains were 1.69, 1.34, and 1.15 times higher than the measured strains for A, B, and C, respectively, and lower than the experimental strains for D (factor = 0.91). In conclusion, we demonstrated that specimen-specific {FE} analyses provide accurate estimates of peri-implant bone strains in the rat tibia loading model. Further investigations of the bone-implant interface are needed to quantify implant osseointegration.},

The resulting numerical scheme does not require boundary fitting meshes and avoids boundary locking by switching the elements intersected by the boundary to a discontinuous Galerkin approximation. Special emphasis is placed on the construction of a method that retains an optimal convergence rate in the presence of non-homogeneous essential and natural boundary conditions. The role of each one of the approximations introduced is illustrated by analyzing an analog problem in one spatial dimension. Finally, extensive two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear elasticity problems verify that the proposed method leads to optimal convergence rates under combinations of essential and natural boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {Goal-oriented error estimates ({GOEE}) have become popular tools to quantify and control the local error in quantities of interest ({QoI}), which are often more pertinent than local errors in energy for design purposes (e.g. the mean stress or mean displacement in a particular area, the stress intensity factor for fracture problems). These {GOEE} are one of the key unsolved problems of advanced engineering applications in, for example, the aerospace industry. This work presents a simple recovery-based error estimation technique for {QoIs} whose main characteristic is the use of an enhanced version of the Superconvergent Patch Recovery ({SPR}) technique previously used for error estimation in the energy norm. This enhanced {SPR} technique is used to recover both the primal and dual solutions. It provides a nearly statically admissible stress field that results in accurate estimations of the local contributions to the discretisation error in the {QoI} and, therefore, in an accurate estimation of this magnitude. This approach leads to a technique with a reasonable computational cost that could easily be implemented into already available finite element codes, or as an independent postprocessing tool.},

This classic computational geometry problem is studied from the point of view of the efficiency, extendibility to any dimensionality, and ease of implementation. A new solution to {DT} is proposed, based on an original interpretation of the well-known Divide and Conquer paradigm. One of the main characteristics of this new algorithm is its generality: it can be simply extended to triangulate point sets in any dimension. The technique adopted is very efficient and presents a subquadratic behaviour in real applications in E3, although its computational complexity does not improve the theoretical bounds reported in the literature. An evaluation of the performance on a number of datasets is reported, together with a comparison with other {DT} algorithms.},

	abstract = {Numerical methods that are able to predict the failure of technical structures due to fracture are important in many engineering applications. One of these approaches, the so-called phase field method, represents cracks by means of an additional continuous field variable. This strategy avoids some of the main drawbacks of a sharp interface description of cracks. For example, it is not necessary to track or model crack faces explicitly, which allows a simple algorithmic treatment. The phase field model for brittle fracture presented in Kuhn and Müller (Eng Fract Mech 77(18):3625–3634, 2010) assumes quasi-static loading conditions. However dynamic effects have a great impact on the crack growth in many practical applications. Therefore this investigation presents an extension of the quasi-static phase field model for fracture from Kuhn and Müller (Eng Fract Mech 77(18):3625–3634, 2010) to the dynamic case. First of all Hamilton’s principle is applied to derive a coupled set of Euler-Lagrange equations that govern the mechanical behaviour of the body as well as the crack growth. Subsequently the model is implemented in a finite element scheme which allows to solve several test problems numerically. The numerical examples illustrate the capabilities of the developed approach to dynamic fracture in brittle materials.},

	title = {Numerical homogenization strategies for cellular materials with applications in structural mechanics},
	url = {http://d-nb.info/1048542335/34},
	abstract = {Cellular materials are of increasing interest since they offer a unique combination of proper-
ties like, for example, high mechanical stiffness or damping features and low weight. However,
the modeling and computation of such materials is difficult due to size dependent boundary
layer effects and deformation-induced anisotropy caused by reorientations and cell buckling.
In order to capture such effects, there exist a variety of analytical and numerical methods.
In this thesis numerical approaches are developed and applied, mainly focusing on numerical
homogenization techniques. These multiscale techniques are based on the principle of scale
separation, where an explicit microstructure is embedded into a macroscopic framework. The
scales are coupled together by projection of macroscopic strain-like quantities and homoge-
nization of microscopic stress-like quantities. Therefore, a nested boundary value problem,
commonly referred to as the {FE} 2 -problem, has to be solved. Depending on the underlying
continuum theory there are first-order and higher-order {FE} 2 -schemes. In earlier {FE} 2 -schemes,
the spatial discretization of the microscale was based on (dimensionally reduced) low-order
finite elements. This work applies higher-order continuum finite element methods, which are
known to be highly efficient and very robust.
In particular, three different homogenization schemes have been developed: A two-dimensional
hyperelastic first-order {FE} 2 -scheme using classical continua has been applied on both scales
to investigate cellular materials under large deformations focusing on deformation-induced
anisotropy. In order to detect size effects, a higher-order {FE} 2 -scheme with restriction to 2D
and small deformations has been designed. It is based on the micromorphic continuum theory
and includes its subcontinua like, for example, the micropolar theory. The results of these
schemes have been verified successfully by microscopically resolved reference computations.
In three dimensions a first-order homogenization approach was developed, which computes
effective linear elastic properties of any microstructured material whereby the microstructure
is represented by computed tomography (micro {CT}-scans). The key feature of this approach
is the application of a higher-order fictitious domain method allowing for fast and simple
discretization of micro {CT}-scans. The approach has been verified numerically by considering
solid- and foam-like materials and valiyeard by comparision to experiments with commercially
available foams. In the validation the pure foam material under compression and shear has
been investigated and in addition sandwich plates consisting of aluminum faceplates and a
foamed core were subjected to bending experiments.
The thesis concludes with microscopic stability investigations of two- and three-dimensional
open-cell foam-like structures under large strain compression whereby the discretization has
been performed by anisotropic hyperelastic higher-order finite elements. It could be observed
that cellular materials under compression do not exhibit any distinct point of instability, since
buckling of the individual cell walls does not occur simultaneously. This observation is in
accordance with experimental investigations.},

This paper presents an effective integration approach for voxel-based models of linear elasticity that drastically reduces the computational effort on cell level. The applied strategy allows the pre- computation of an essential part of the cell matrices and vectors of higher order, representing stiffness and load, respectively. Several benchmark problems show the potential of the proposed method in particular for heterogeneous material properties as common in biomedical applications based on computer tomography scans. The applied strategy ensures a fast computation for time-critical simulations and even allows user- interactive simulations formodels of moderate size at a high level of accuracy.},

	abstract = {For the last 30 yr, since Tarantola's pioneering theoretical study of waveform inversion, geophysicists and applied mathematicians have utilized a waveform inversion to delineate the earth's structures. However, successful applications of waveform inversion to real data are nominal. The failures are mainly caused by the high non-linearity of the waveform inversion and the real data containing insufficient low-frequency components. We propose a waveform inversion algorithm that is robust and is not sensitive to the initial model by exploiting the wavefield in the Laplace domain and the adjoint property of the wave equation. The wavefield in the Laplace domain is equivalent to the zero frequency component of the damped wavefield. Therefore, the inversion of Poisson's equation in electrical prospecting can be viewed as a waveform inversion problem, exploiting the zero frequency component of an undamped wavefield. Since our inversion algorithm in the Laplace domain is strongly associated with the nature of {DC} inversion for Poisson's equation in electrical prospecting, our algorithm can generate a velocity model that is equivalent to a long-wavelength velocity model (a smooth velocity model). Through numerical tests, we found that the Laplace-transformed wavefields for optimally low Laplace damping constants are critically needed in our algorithm as the low-frequency components are necessary in the waveform inversion of the frequency domain. We note that the objective function by l2 norm of the logarithmic wavefield in the Laplace domain behaves as if it has no local minimum points in low and high Laplace damping constants. Moreover, we note that the forward modelling in the Laplace domain could be accurately calculated by using a coarser grid of several hundreds of metres than that of the frequency domain. Numerical tests of the salt dome model with high-velocity contrast demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm to both synthetic and real data. To apply our algorithm to real data more successfully, we need to improve the accuracy of the Laplace transformation for the wavefields in the time domain. However, our waveform inversion in the Laplace domain can be successfully applied to real data since our algorithm has more advantages in forward modelling and inversion than those in the frequency domain.},

The coupling strategy exploits the optimization program behind {LME} approximation, treats isogeometric and {LME} basis functions on an equal footing in the reproducibility constraints, but views the former as data in the constrained minimization. The resulting scheme exploits the best features and overcomes the main drawbacks of each of these approximants. Indeed, it preserves the high fidelity boundary representation (exact {CAD} geometry) of isogeometric analysis, out of reach for bare meshfree methods, and easily handles volume discretization and unstructured grids with possibly local refinement, while maintaining the smoothness and non-negativity of the basis functions. We implement the method with B-Splines in two dimensions, but the procedure carries over to higher spatial dimensions or to other non-negative approximants such as {NURBS} or subdivision schemes. The performance of the method is illustrated with the heat equation, and linear and nonlinear elasticity. The ability of the proposed method to impose directly essential boundary conditions in non-convex domains, and to deal with unstructured grids and local refinement in domains of complex geometry and topology is highlighted by the numerical examples.},

	url = {http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1093297/1093297.pdf},
	abstract = {The thesis at hand addresses two recently introduced concepts intended to support an efficient
interaction between geometrical models and finite element analysis: the finite cell method and
isogeometric analysis.
In the context of the finite cell method ({FCM}), the state of the art is complemented by
four new aspects: First, the {FCM} is generalized as a seamless geometry-through-analysis
procedure, independent of a special high-order basis. Second, the B-spline version of the {FCM}
is introduced, which applies high-order and high-continuity B-spline bases within the {FCM}
concept. Third, the idea of deformation resetting is motivated, which allows for the extension
of the finite cell method to geometrically nonlinear problems. Fourth, the {FCM} is combined
with hierarchical hp-d adaptivity for local mesh refinement.
In the context of isogeometric analysis ({IGA}), the principle of subdivision is used to derive
a hierarchical refinement procedure for non-uniform rational B-splines ({NURBS}). It combines
full analysis suitability in 2D and 3D with straightforward implementation in tree data struc-
tures and thus constitutes a suitable basis for local refinement in {NURBS} based {IGA}. It is
furthermore demonstrated that the combination of the B-spline version of the {FCM} and hi-
erarchical refinement of {NURBS} opens the door for a seamless {IGA} design-through-analysis
procedure for complex T-spline based engineering parts and assemblies, which is able to adap-
tively resolve local features in geometry and solution fields.},

The procedures allow not only the final global energy norm error to be well estimated using hierarchic p-refinement, but in addition give a nearly optimal mesh. The design of this is guided by the local information computed on the previous mesh. The desired accuracy can always be obtained within one or at most two h–p-refinements. The rate of convergence of the adaptive h–p-version analysis procedures has been tested for some examples and found to be very strong. The presented procedures can easily be incorporated into existing p- or h-type code structures.},

The starting point for our homogenization might be either a computer-aided design of a heterogeneous material or a three-dimensional computer tomography ({CT}-scan) of the specimen of interest. A fully automatic discretization in terms of finite cells, applying a hierarchic extension process to control the discretization error, is utilized to solve the corresponding boundary value problems arising during the homogenization. Special emphasis is placed on the numerical treatment of boundary conditions. To this end we apply the window method, which can be interpreted as a variant of the self-consistency method. Several numerical examples ranging from porous materials to fiber-reinforced composites will be presented, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach. The homogenization procedure will be also applied to a foam, a {CT}-scan of which is available.},

Refined local mesh is superimposed on global mesh for the region of interest. It is an adaptive mesh refinement method, which allows local refinement of the mesh without introducing transition region or multi-point constraints. By applying appropriate boundary conditions on the local superimposed mesh, singularity in the global stiffness matrix can be avoided and inter-element compatibility conditions can be satisfied. Effectiveness of the present technique is demonstrated by means of numerical examples of linear static, dynamic and buckling problems of elasticity. Moreover, effectiveness of the present procedure is tested for problems with curved geometries and with distorted grids. Also, various solutions schemes are investigated for effective analysis using the present method.},

	shorttitle = {Adaptive Finite Element Methods},
	abstract = {The adaptive finite element method ({FEM}) was developed in the early 1980s. The basic concept of adaptivity developed in the {FEM} is that, when a physical problem is analyzed using finite elements, there exist some discretization errors caused owing to the use of the finite element model. These errors are calculated in order to assess the accuracy of the solution obtained. If the errors are large, then the finite element model is refined through reducing the size of elements or increasing the order of interpolation functions. The new model is re-analyzed and the errors in the new model are recalculated. This procedure is continued until the calculated errors fall below the specified permissible values. The key features in the adaptive {FEM} are the estimation of discretization errors and the refinement of finite element models. This paper presents a brief review of the methods for error estimates and adaptive refinement processes applied to finite element calculations. The basic theories and principles of estimating finite element discretization errors and refining finite element models are presented. This review article contains 131 references.},

	abstract = {Generating finiteelement discretizations with direct interface parameterizations constitutes a considerable computational expense in case of complexinterfacegeometries. The paper at hand introduces a B-splinefiniteelementmethod, which circumvents parameterization of interfaces and offers fast and easy meshing irrespective of the geometric complexity involved. Its core idea is the adaptive approximation of discontinuities by hierarchical grid refinement, which adds several levels of local basis functions in the close vicinity of interfaces, but unfitted to their exact location, so that a simple regular grid of knot span elements can be maintained. Numerical experiments show that an hp-refinement strategy, which simultaneously increases the polynomial degree of the B-spline basis and the levels of refinement around interfaces, achieves exponential rates of convergence despite the presence of discontinuities. It is also demonstrated that the {hierarchicalB}-spline {FEM} can be used to transfer the recently introduced Finite Cell concept to geometrically nonlinear problems. Its computational performance, imposition of unfitted boundary conditions and fast hierarchical grid generation are illustrated for a set of benchmark problems in one, two and three dimensions, and the advantages of the regular grid approach for complexgeometries are demonstrated by the geometrically nonlinear simulation of a voxel based foam composite.},

	abstract = {Hip fracture is a serious and common injury that can lead to permanent disability, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and death. Research to help prevent these fractures is essential. Computed tomographic ({CT}) scan-based finite element ({FE}) modeling is a tool that can predict proximal femoral fracture loads in vitro. Because this tool might be used in vivo, this study examined whether {FE} models generated from {CT} scans in situ and in vitro yield comparable predictions of proximal femoral fracture load. {CT} scans of the left proximal femur of two human cadavers were obtained in situ and in vitro, and three-dimensional {FE} models employing nonlinear mechanical properties were generated from each {CT} scan. The models were evaluated under single-limb stance-type loading by applying displacements incrementally to the femoral head. The {FE}-predicted fracture load ({FFE}) was the maximum femoral head reaction force. {FFE} for the in situ-derived models for the two subjects were 5.2 and 13.3\% greater than for the in vitro-derived models. These results demonstrate that using {CT} scan data obtained in situ instead of in vitro to generate {FE} models can lead to substantially different predicted fracture loads. This effect must be considered when using this technology in vivo.},

It develops the basic finite element method mathematical formulation, beginning with physical considerations, proceeding to the well-established variation approach, and placing a strong emphasis on the versatile method of weighted residuals, which has shown itself to be important in nonstructural applications.The authors demonstrate the tremendous power of the finite element method to solve problems that classical methods cannot handle, including elasticity problems, general field problems, heat transfer problems, and fluid mechanics problems. They supply practical information on boundary conditions and mesh generation, and they offer a fresh perspective on finite element analysis with an overview of the current state of finite element optimal design.Supplemented with numerous real-world problems and examples taken directly from the authors' experience in industry and research, The Finite Element Method for Engineers, Fourth Edition gives readers the real insight needed to apply the method to challenging problems and to reason out solutions that cannot be found in any textbook.},

	abstract = {The problem of boundary conditions enforcement in meshless methods has been solved in the literature by several approaches. In the present paper, the moving least-squares ({MLS}) approximation is introduced in the total potential energy functional for the elastic solid problem and an augmented Lagrangian term is added to satisfy essential boundary conditions. The method can be easily extended to any kind of constraint for the approximation variables. The solution is found by iterating alternatively on approximation variables and on Lagrange multipliers. The advantages of the proposed formulation are: (a) the ability to deal with the same approach with any constraint type; (b) the number of the variables is not increased by the Lagrange multipliers; (c) the Hessian of the functional w.r.t. the approximation variables is banded, well conditioned and strictly positive definite and (d) the cost of the augmented Lagrangian iteration is a very small fraction of the global computing time. Therefore, the augmented Lagrangian element-free ({ALEF}) approach represents an attractive and very efficient numerical tool, not only for the boundary conditions enforcement, but also for the solution of interface and non-linear problems.

The maximal rate of {ATP} hydrolysis is approx. 20 mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme preparation is used here. At optimal Ca(2+) concentration, the Mg(2+) has an inhibitory effect. The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by Ca(2+). Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for {ATP} is the highest. The Km for {ATP} is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal {pH} for Ca(2+) activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2. Well known inhibitors of (Na+ + K+)-{ATPase}, mitochondria {ATPase} and Ca(2+)-{ATPase} in the erthrocyte do not inhibit the enzyme.

	title = {Double Experimental Procedure for Model-Specific Finite Element Analysis of the Human Femur and Trabecular Bone},
	abstract = {Hip replacement (total hip replacement), is a worldwide common surgical procedure in which the hip joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant. Replacing the hip joint consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head. Such joint replacement orthopaedicsurgery generally is conducted to relieve arthritis pain or fix severe physical joint damage
as part of hip fracture treatment.
In order to optimize this surgical procedure and the prosthetics used in it, accurate
computational models of the bone are needed, which additionally require a large amount of
information from the biomechanical field.
The stability of bone depends upon material properties and geometry. One of the major
parameters of the material properties is the Young ́s (elastic) modulus E. This value
describes the deformation under loading for linear elastic behavior.
There are two types of bone tissue regarding its density and porosity: cortical (or
compact) bone and trabecular (or cancellous) bone. Cortical bone has a porosity ranging
between 5\% and 10\% and it is usually found along the exterior shaft section of long bones.
Cortical bone forms the outer shell around the trabecular bone in joints and in vertebrae
(Martin, 1998). Trabecular bone has a porosity ranging from 75\% to 90\%. It is usuallyfound in cubicoidal bones (such as vertebrae), flat bones (such as the pelvis) at the end oflong bones (such as the femur). Cortical bone accounts for about 80\% of the total skeletalmass while trabecular bone constitutes some 70\% for the skeletal volume.
The trabecular bone is more active, more subject to bone turnover, to remodeling.Common osteoporotic fractures sites, the wrist, the hip, and the spine, have a relativelyhigh trabecular bone to cortical ratio. These areas rely on trabecular bone for strength. Therefore the osteoporosis may be considered as the trabecular bone loss, decrease of the density and the mechanical properties.
The aim of this work is to develop a procedure for generating specific finite element models of the human femur from a complete biomechanical analysis of the bone and of the trabecular tissue. This procedure includes:
 Design of the testing procedure and devices
 Sample preparation
 Experimental test of human femora
 Experimental test of trabecular specimens
 Generation of material models from the mechanical tests
 {FE} modeling and calculations
 Validation of the simulations with the experimental observations},

In particular, it is shown that given any preconditioner Mp to  {CG}, a multi-p preconditioner Bp based on Mp can be constructed, which leads to a smaller condition number (and hence faster convergence).Numerical experiments on representative problems indicate that the condition numbers after multi-p preconditionings are, in fact, independent of p. The numerical results also show greater efficiency for the preconditioned conjugate gradient ({PCG}) method with the multi-p preconditioners in terms of number of iterations and {CPU} time when compared with two sophisticated linear equation solvers: (1) a direct frontal solver specially designed for the p-version of the finite element analysis; (2) a highly tuned {PCG} code in {ITPACK}2C, http://www.netlib.org.itpack/, 1994.

In boundary-coupled problems, the flux evaluation appears implicitly in the formulation and consequently, improper flux evaluation can lead to instability. Finite-element approximations of primal and dual problems corresponding to improper formulations can therefore be nonconvergent or display suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we consider the main aspects of flux evaluation in finite-element approximations of boundary-coupled problems. Based on a model problem, we consider various formulations and illustrate the implications for corresponding primal and dual problems. In addition, we discuss the extension to free-boundary problems, fluid-structure interaction, and electro-osmosis applications.},

Allowing for hanging nodes, locally refined meshes may be easily generated to improve the resolution of general, i.e. model-independent, steep gradients in the problem under consideration. Hence, a combination of these meshes with {XFEM} facilitates an appropriate modeling of jumps and kinks within elements that interact with steep gradients. Examples for such an interaction are, e.g. found in stress fields near crack fronts or in boundary layers near internal interfaces between two fluids. The two approaches for {XFEM} based on locally refined meshes with hanging nodes basically differ in whether (enriched) degrees of freedom are associated with the hanging nodes. Both approaches are applied to problems in linear elasticity and incompressible flows},

	abstract = {If patient-specific finite element models of the spine could be developed, they would offer enormous opportunities in the diagnosis and management of back problems. Several generic models have been developed in the past, but there has been very little detailed examination of the sensitivity of these models' characteristics to the input parameters. This relationship must be thoroughly understood if representative patient-specific models are to be realized and used with confidence. In particular, the performance of the intervertebral discs are central to any spine model and need detailed investigation first.
A generic non-linear model of an intervertebral disc was developed and subjected to compressive, flexion and torsional loading regimes. The effects of both material and geometric non-linearities were investigated for the three loading schemes and the results compared with experimental data. The basic material properties of the fibres, annulus and nucleus were then varied and the effects on the stiffness, annulus bulge and annulus stresses analysed.
The results showed that the non-linear geometry assumption had a significant effect on the compression characteristics, whereas the non-linear material option did not. In contrast, the material non-linearity was more important for the flexural and torsional loading schemes. Thus, the inclusion of non-linear material and geometry analysis options in finite element models of intervertebral discs is necessary to predict in vivo load-deflection characteristics accurately.
When the influence of the material properties was examined in detail, it was found that the fibre properties did not have a significant effect on the compressive stiffness of the disc but did affect the flexural and torsional stiffnesses by up to ±20 per cent. All loading modes were sensitive to the annulus properties with stiffnesses varying by up to ±16 per cent. The model also revealed that for a particular compressive deformation or flexural or torsional rotation, the disc bulge was not sensitive to any of the material properties over the range of properties considered. The annulus stresses did differ significantly as the material properties were varied (up to 70 per cent under a compressive load and 60 per cent during disc flexion).},

In this paper, a general recovery technique is developed for determining the derivatives (stresses) of the finite element solutions at nodes. The implementation of the recovery technique is simple and cost effective. The technique has been tested for a group of widely used linear, quadratic and cubic elements for both one and two dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered nodal values of the derivatives with linear and cubic elements are superconvergent. One order higher accuracy is achieved by the procedure with linear and cubic elements but two order higher accuracy is achieved for the derivatives with quadratic elements. In particular, an O(h4) convergence of the nodal values of the derivatives for a quadratic triangular element is reported for the first time. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with the widely used smoothing procedure of global L2 projection and other methods. It is found that the derivatives recovered at interelement nodes, by using L2 projection, are also superconvergent for linear elements but not for quadratic elements. Numerical experiments on the convergence of the recovered solutions in the energy norm are also presented. Higher rates of convergence are again observed. The results presented in this part of the paper indicate clearly that a new, powerful and economical process is now available which should supersede the currently used post-processing procedures applied in most codes.},

For members in the first hybrid-stress family, a quasi-linear stress field with ten equilibrating stress modes is derived and employed. To study the effect of including more stress modes in the assumed stress field, another family with two additional stress modes is implemented. On the other hand, two {EAS} element families are constructed with respect to the incompatible displacement modes of two existing incompatible displacement transition element families. Several numerical examples are exercised. It can be seen that the first hybrid-stress family is the most accurate one among the proposed families. Moreover, the {EAS} families are close to the respective incompatible families in accuracy yet the former families are not only more efficient in computation but also more concise in formulation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for imposing Dirichlet conditions weakly on non-fitting finite element meshes. Such conditions, also called embedded Dirichlet conditions, are typically, but not exclusively, encountered when prescribing Dirichlet conditions in the context of the {eXtended} finite element method ({XFEM}). The method's key idea is the use of an additional stress field as the constraining Lagrange multiplier function. The resulting mixed/hybrid formulation is applicable to 1D, 2D and 3D problems. The method does not require stabilization for the Lagrange multiplier unknowns and allows the complete condensation of these unknowns on the element level. Furthermore, only non-zero diagonal-terms are present in the tangent stiffness, which allows the straightforward application of state-of-the-art iterative solvers, like algebraic multigrid ({AMG}) techniques. Within this paper, the method is applied to the linear momentum equation of an elastic continuum and to the transient, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Steady and unsteady benchmark computations show excellent agreement with reference values. The general formulation presented in this paper can also be applied to other continuous field problems.

The present study examines the theory and behavior of such techniques applied specifically to h-p adaptive finite element methods.

	abstract = {The numerical simulation of contact problems is nowadays a standard procedure for many engineering
applications. The contact constraints are usually formulated using special interpolations like the mor-
tar method- at the interface. . In this lecture we will introduce a new scheme that is based on a space
filling mesh in which the contacting bodies can move and interact. The latter is based on a non-classical
approach where the medium will be formulated as an isotropic/anisotropic material with changing char-
acteristics and directions.
The new approach is followed that provides an alternative method to treat contact problems. It avoids
the complexity of the classical schemes related to the exact formulation and enforcement of the contact
constraints. The contacting bodies will be imbedded in a medium. This medium will have assigned
specific material properties that on one hand approximate rigid body movements before contact and on
the other hand account for the contact constraints whenever necessary. Thus the constitutive equations of
the medium have to change their properties. This is related to the magnitude of the parameters in space
with respect to the movement of the bodies. But also a change from isotropic to anisotropic behaviour
will be necessary in order to model frictionless contact in a correct way. A typical computation can be
found in Figure 1 which shows the mesh of the entire domain and the deformed contact state. Details
can be found in [1].},

The treatment of essential boundary conditions with meshfree Galerkin methods is not an easy task due to the non-interpolatory character of the shape functions. Here, the use of an almost forgotten method due to Nitsche from the 1970’s allows us to overcome these problems at virtually no extra computational costs. The method is applicable to general point distributions and leads to positive definite linear systems. The results of our numerical experiments, where we consider discretizations with several million degrees of freedom in two and three dimensions, clearly show that we achieve the optimal convergence rates for regular and singular solutions with the (adaptive) h-version and (augmented) p-version.

The standard finite element spaces are augmented by adding special functions which reflect the known information about the boundary value problem and the input data; e.g., the singular functions obtained from the local asymptotic expansion of the exact solution in the neighborhood of a corner point, etc. The special functions are multiplied with the partition of unity corresponding to the standard linear vertex shape-functions and pasted together with the existing finite element basis to construct an augmented conforming finite element space. In this way, the local approximability afforded by the special functions is included in the approximation, while maintaining the existing infrastructure of finite element codes. The major features of the {GFEM} are: (1) the essential boundary conditions can be imposed exactly as in the standard {FEM}, unlike other partition of unity based methods where this is a major issue; (2) the accuracy of the numerical integration of the entries of the stiffness matrix and load vector is controlled adaptively so that the errors in integration of the special functions do not affect the accuracy of the constructed approximation (this issue also has not been sufficiently addressed in other implementations of partition of unity or meshless methods); and (3) linear dependencies in the system of equations are resolved by employing an easy modification of the direct linear solver. The power of the {GFEM} for solving problems in domains with complex geometry with less error and less computer resources than the standard {FEM} is illustrated by numerical examples.},

scaled boundary finite element method ({SBFEM}) with quadtree mesh of high-
order elements. The cells of the quadtree mesh are modelled as scaled boundary
polygons that can have any number of edges, be of any high orders and rep-
resent the stress singularity around a crack tip accurately without asymptotic
enrichment or other special techniques. Owing to these features, a simple and
automatic meshing algorithm is devised. No special treatment is required for
the hanging nodes and no displacement incompatibility occurs. Curved bound-
aries and cracks are modelled without excessive local refinement. Five numerical
examples are presented to demonstrate the simplicity and applicability of the
proposed technique.},

systems of conservation laws on rectangular domains. The local finite element procedure utilizes spaces
of piecewise-continuous polynomials of arbitrary degree and coordinated explicit Runge-Kutta temporal integration.
A solution limiting procedure produces monotonic solutions near discontinuities while maintaining
high-order accuracy near smooth extrema. A modified tiling procedure maintains processor load balance on
parallel, distributed-memory {MIMD} computers by migrating finite elements between processors in overlapping
neighborhoods to produce locally balanced computations. Grids are stored in tree data structures, with finer grids
being offspring of coarser ones. Within each grid, {AVL} trees simplify the transfer of information between neighboring
processors and the insertion and deletion of elements as they migrate between processors. Computations
involving Burgers' and Euler's equations of inviscid flow demonstrate the effectiveness of the hp-refinement
and balancing procedures relative to non-balanced adaptive and balanced non-adaptive procedures.},

Typically, a gap function which is non-differentiable at the point of contact is used in these kind of approaches. The gap function can be seen as the Macaulay bracket of some distance function, where the latter is differentiable at the point of contact. In this article, we propose to use the distance function directly instead of using the gap function. This will give rise to a formulation involving inequality constraints. This approach eliminates the artificially introduced non-differentiability. To this end we propose a barrier algorithm as the method of choice to solve the problem. The method originates in optimization literature, where convergence proofs for the method are available. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Patient-specific finite element ({PSFE}) models based on quantitative computer tomography ({qCT}) are generally used to "predict" the biomechanical response of human bones with the future goal to be applied in clinical decision-making. However, clinical applications require a well valiyeard tool that is free of numerical errors and furthermore match closely experimental findings. In previous studies, not all measurable data (strains and displacements) were considered for validation. Furthermore, the same research group performed both the experiments and {PSFE} analyses; thus, the validation may have been biased. The aim of the present study was therefore to valiyear {PSFE} models with biomechanical experiments, and to address the above-mentioned issues of measurable data and validation bias. A {PSFE} model (p-method) of each cadaver femur (n = 12) was generated based on {qCT} scans of the specimens. The models were valiyeard by biomechanical in-vitro experiments, which determined strains and local displacements on the bone surface and the axial stiffness of the specimens. The validation was performed in a double-blinded manner by two different research institutes to avoid any bias. Inspecting all measurements (155 values), the numerical results correlated well with the experimental results (R(2) = 0.93, slope 1.0093, mean of absolute deviations 22\%). In conclusion, a method to generate {PSFE} models from {qCT} scans was used in this study on a sample size not yet considered in the past, and compared to experiments in a douple-blinded manner. The results demonstrate that the presented method is in an advanced stage, and can be used in clinical computer-aided decision-making.},

The first formulation introduces the contact constraints via Lagrange multipliers, the other employs the penalty method. Both formulations differ in size and the way of fulfilling the contact constraints, thus different strategies to determine the permanently changing contact area are required. Starting from the contact potential energy, the variational formulation, the linearization and finally the matrix formulation of both methods are derived. In combination with different contact detection methods the global solution algorithm is applied to different two-dimensional examples.},

The connection between the geometry and the approximation is obtained by sharing the quadtree trees of the two meshes. Numerical examples involving level-set based parts, convergence studies, mechanical computations and numerical homogenization show good promise for this approach.},

We consider techniques for the adaptive refinement of triangulations used with the finite element method with piecewise linear functions. Several such techniques that differ mainly in the method for dividing triangles and the method for indicating which triangles have the largest error have been developed. We describe four methods for dividing triangles and eight methods for indicating errors. Angle bounds for the triangle division methods are compared. All combinations of triangle divisions and error indicators are compared in a numerical experiment using a population of eight test problems with a variety of difficulties (peaks, boundary layers, singularities, etc.). The comparison is based on the L-infinity norm of the error versus the number of vertices. It is found that all of the methods produce asymptotically optimal grids and that the number of vertices needed for a given error rarely differs by more than a factor of two.},

For these problems a finite element formulation is presented which is based on a new frictional interface law and fully implicit algorithmic treatment for the integration of the constitutive relations and the dynamics. The first is performed via radial return schemes, which are well established in computational plasticity. As radial return methods are amenable to consistent linearizations, a full Newton-type algorithm can be constructed within a time step. This leads, however, to non-symmetric tangent matrices. Several examples compare this method with other formulations and shows its efficiency.},

Expressing mesh transformations as grammar productions is useful for concurrency analysis thanks to exhibiting the partial causality order (Lamport relationship) between atomic operations. It occurs that a straightforward approach to modeling this process via grammar productions leads to potential deadlock in h-adaptation of the mesh. This fact is shown on a Petri net model of an exemplary adaptation. Therefore auxiliary productions are added to the grammar in order to ensure that any sequence of productions allowed by the grammar does not lead to a deadlock state. The fact that the enhanced grammar is deadlock-free is proven via a corresponding Petri net model. The proof has been performed by means of reachability graph construction and analysis. The paper is concluded with numerical simulations of magnetolluric measurements where the deadlock problem occurred.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a variationally consistent formulation for the weak enforcement of essential boundary conditions as an extension to the finite cell method, a fictitious domain method of higher order. The absence of boundary fitted elements in fictitious domain or immersed boundary methods significantly restricts a strong enforcement of essential boundary conditions to models where the boundary of the solution domain coincides with the embedding analysis domain. Penalty methods and Lagrange multiplier methods are adequate means to overcome this limitation but often suffer from various drawbacks with severe consequences for a stable and accurate solution of the governing system of equations. In this contribution, we follow the idea of {NITSCHE} who developed a stable scheme for the solution of the Laplace problem taking weak boundary conditions into account. An extension to problems from linear elasticity shows an appropriate behavior with regard to numerical stability, accuracy and an adequate convergence behavior. {NURBS} are chosen as a high-order approximation basis to benefit from their smoothness and flexibility in the process of uniform model refinement.},

The method is applied to a reaction-diffusion problem resulting from semiconductor process simulation.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Established methods of assessing bone mineral density are associated with additional radiation exposure to the patient. In this study, we aimed to valiyear a method of assessing bone mineral density in routine multidetector row {CT} of the lumbar spine.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: In 38 patients, bone mineral density was assessed in quantitative {CT} as a standard of reference and in sagittal reformations derived from standard multidetector row {CT} studies without {IV} contrast. {MDCT}-to-quantitative {CT} conversion equations were calculated and then applied to baseline multidetector row scans of another 62 patients. After a mean follow-up of 15 ± 6 months, patients were re-assessed for incidental fractures and screw loosening after spondylodesis (n = 49).
{RESULTS}: We observed conversion equations bone mineral {densityMDCT} = 0.78 × Hounsfield {unitMDCTmg}/{mL} (correlation with bone mineral densityquantitative {CT}, R(2) = 0.92, P {\textless} .001) for 120 {kV}(peak) tube voltage and bone mineral {densityMDCT} = 0.86 × Hounsfield {unitMDCTmg}/{mL} (R(2) = 0.81, P {\textless} .001) for 140 {kVp}, respectively. Seven patients (11.3\%) had existing osteoporotic vertebral fractures at baseline, while 8 patients (12.9\%) showed incidental osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Screw loosening was detected in 28 patients (57.1\% of patients with spondylodesis). Patients with existing vertebral fractures showed significantly lower bone mineral {densityMDCT} than patients without fractures (P {\textless} .01). At follow-up, patients with incidental fractures and screw loosening after spondylodesis, respectively, showed significantly lower baseline bone mineral {densityMDCT} (P {\textless} .001 each).
{CONCLUSIONS}: This longitudinal study demonstrated that converted bone mineral density values derived from routine lumbar spine multidetector row {CT} adequately differentiated patients with and without osteoporotic fractures and could predict incidental fractures and screw loosening after spondylodesis.},

The convergence rates are of algebraic type for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}h{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-, {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-, and the {\textless}i{\textgreater}rp{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-version of the {FEM}.

One can circumvent this using the mortar method which includes a weak projection of the contact constraints.
In this paper we present a penalty formulation based on the mortar concept for two-dimensional large deformation frictional contact. The discretization of the contact surfaces contains quadratic approximations which can be used within a quadratic approximation of the solid elements. To obtain a simple and efficient matrix formulation, the moving friction cone algorithm is applied.},

In Model-Analysis separation, analysis-related classes are separated from those related to finite element modelling. Model-{UI} separation separates responsibilities related to the user interface from model classes. Modular Element uses object composition to reduce duplication in element type classes while avoiding the problems associated with class inheritance. Composite Element lets clients handle substructures and elements uniformly. Decomposing the analysis subsystem as in Modular Analyzer increases reuse and flexibility. Alternative solutions to each pattern are also reviewed.},

Issues regarding momentum conservation, large deformations, computational efficiency and bending are considered. In particular, a mortar method formulation that is invariant to rigid body rotations is introduced. A scheme is presented for the numerical integration of the mortar surface projection integrals applicable to arbitrary 3D curved dissimilar interfaces. Here, integration need only be performed at problem initialization such that coefficients can be stored and used throughout a quasi-static time stepping process even for large deformation problems. A degree of freedom reduction scheme exploiting the dual space interpolation method such that direct linear solution techniques can be applied without Lagrange multipliers is proposed. This provided a significant reduction in factorization times. Example problems which touch on the aforementioned solid mechanics related issues are presented.

The parallel implementation is an extension of the sequential code 3Dhp90, which generates, in a fully automatic mode, optimal hp meshes for various boundary value problems. The system constitutes an infrastructure for a class of parallel hp adaptive computations. Its modular structure allows for an independent parallelization of each component of the system. The presented work addresses parallelization of these components, including distributed data structures, load balancing and domain redistribution, parallel (multi-frontal) solver, optimal hp mesh refinements, and a main control module. All components communicate through a distributed data structure, and the control module synchronizes work of all components. The concept of ghost elements has been used to simplify the communication algorithms for parallel mesh refinements. The system has been implemented in Fortran 90 and {MPI}, and the load balancing is done through an interface with the {ZOLTAN} library. Numerical results are presented for the model Fichera problem.},

	title = {The Finite Cell Method for spatially varying dispersions in coupled multispecies reactive transprot problems},
	abstract = {Colloidal transport and dynamics in porous media can be well described by multi-species reactive transport equations where the governing equations are coupled by first-order reactions. The solution of this type of coupled equations causes considerable computational effort. Additional difficulty is caused by the spatial inhomogeneity of species in porous media which calls for spatially varying dispersion coefficients. In such a setting, analytic solutions are only available for special cases. In the forthcoming paper, we will firstly present a spatial discretization of the problem by the finite cell method, which is an embedded domain approach using a high order finite element method, where the time domain is discretized by finite differences. We will demonstrate the efficiency and stability of this approach and discuss further advantages. Secondly, we will present different methods to solve the coupled problem where the coupling stems from the reactive terms. Here, we will compare different conventional fixed-point iteration methods with a decoupling scheme utilized for the derivation of analytical solutions. The basic idea is to decompose the multiple reactive species by introducing auxiliary variables. The decoupling scheme can be carried over to our numerical framework, i.e. our in-house code {AdhoC}, which results in the computational time speedup in the order of one magnitude. We will verify all presented numerical schemes by comparison to analytic solutions or benchmark problems and discuss their efficiency. We will conclude the final paper with a practical application.},

	abstract = {The subject of this paper is the fast adaptive composite grid ({FAC}) method for solving variationally posed differential boundary value problems. Related to local defect corrections ({LDC}) and multilevel adaptive techniques ({MLAT}), an important difference is that {FAC} forces the user to specify the discrete problem on the finest composite grid — it is not rather an implicit result of the adaptive process. The advantages are that {FAC} can more readily meet practical objectives, does not suffer from some of the practical limitations of (“natural”) versions of {LDC} and {MLAT}, and lends itself to a simple theory. The latter is the subject of this paper.},

On the one hand, it is possible to generate geometrical models through segmentation, whereupon {FE} models would be obtained using standard mesh generators. On the other hand, we can create a Cartesian grid of uniform hexahedra in which the elements fit each pixel/voxel perfectly. In both cases, geometries will take part during the analysis either as complete models, in the first case, or as auxiliary entities, to apply boundary conditions properly for instance, in the second case. In any case, once the geometrical entities have been obtained from the medical image, the efficient generation of an accurate Finite Element model for numerical simulation in not trivial. The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient integration strategy, using Cartesian meshes, of 3D geometries defined by parametric surfaces, i.e. {NURBS}, obtained from medical images.},

Crucial applications in the area of dynamic response analysis and stochastic estimation of material degradation can be cited as important cases. Integration procedures on finite domains underlie physically acceptable averaging processes. Unlike one-dimensional cases, inte- grals within arbitrary areas and volumes cannot be approximated by a Gaussian form of numerical quadrature. Here the divergence theorem is applied once and twice, respectively, for polygonal and polyhedral integration domains, to construct integrals on boundary wireframes. The sum of Gaussian quadrature values on linear segments of the wireframe yields the final result of numerical integration on a finite element.},

This is achieved by overlaying portions of the finite-element mesh where discontinuities need to be embedded with a finite-element mesh which is discontinuous across the crack faces (containing unconstrained double nodes along the discontinuity). By this technique crack propagation can be simulated by advancing the crack front in the superimposed mesh only, keeping the base mesh fixed and unaware of the crack existence. The hierarchical structure of the method ensures computational efficiency, especially in linear systems. Numerical experiments for mode I and mixed-mode problems are presented to valiyear the present formulation.},

The method can be routinely used as a global-local method and/or as an adaptive technique which provides a measure of reliability of global and local computations.

Many such E-ρ relationships are available based on different experiments on femur specimens with a large spread due to uncertainties. The first goal of this study is to pool and analyze the relevant available experimental data and develop a {stochasticE}-ρ relationship. This analysis highlights that there is no experimental data available to cover the entire density range of the human femur and that some "popular" E-ρ relationships are based on data that contains extreme scatter, while others are based on a very limited amount of information. The second goal is to use the newly developed stochastic E-ρ relationship in high-order finite element analyses ({FEAs}) for the computation of strains and displacements in two human proximal femurs, mimicking in vitro experiments. When compared with the experimental observations, the {FEA} predictions using the median of the stochastic E-ρ relationship follow the underlying distribution of the stochastic E-ρ relationship. Thus, most deviations of the {FEA} predictions from experimental observations can possibly be explained by uncertain elastic properties of the femur.},

Therefore auxiliary productions are added to the grammar in order to ensure that any sequence of productions allowed by the grammar does not lead to a deadlock state. The fact that the enhanced grammar is deadlock-free is proven via a corresponding Petri net model. The proof has been performed by means of reachability graph construction and analysis. The paper is enhanced with numerical simulations of magnetolluric measurements where the deadlock problem occured.},

This holds for tasks like how to define sets of points to approximate, interpolate, or integrate certain classes of functions as accurate as possible as well as for the numerical solution of differential equations. Introduced by Zenger in 1990 and based on hierarchical tensor product approximation spaces, sparse grids have turned out to be a very efficient approach in order to improve the ratio of invested storage and computing time to the achieved accuracy for many problems in the areas mentioned above. Concerning the sparse grid finite element discretization of elliptic partial differential equations, recently, the class of problems that can be tackled has been enlarged significantly. First, the tensor product approach led to the formulation of unidirectional algorithms which are essentially independent of the number d of dimensions. Second, techniques for the treatme...},

	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient approach to model contact interfaces of joints in finite element analysis ({FEA}) with segment-to-segment contact elements like thin layer or zero thickness elements. These elements originate from geomechanics and have been applied recently in modal analysis as an efficient way to define the contact stiffness of fixed joints for model updating. A big advantage of these elements is that no global contact search algorithm is employed as used in master–slave contacts. Contact search algorithms are not necessary for modelling contact interfaces of fixed joints since the interfaces are always in contact and restricted to small relative movements, which saves much computing time. We first give an introduction into the theory of segment-to-segment contact elements leading to zero thickness and thin layer elements. As a new application of zero thickness elements, we demonstrate the implementation of a structural contact damping model, derived from a Masing model, as non-linear constitutive laws for the contact element. This damping model takes into account the non-linear influence of frictional microslip in the contact interface of fixed joints. With this model we simulate the non-linear response of a bolted structure. This approach constitutes a new way to simulate multi-degree-of-freedom systems with structural joints and predict modal damping properties.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates a non-continuous discretization strategy in the context of the high order Finite Element Method (p-{FEM}) for 3D elastostatic analyses. The approach is known as a Mortar Element Method, which we use to couple hexahedral and tetrahedral elements. The tetrahedron’s shape functions developed in this work are based on a degenerated hexahe- dral to tetrahedral mapping called Duffy transformation. They consist of integrated Legendre polynomials exhibiting a tensor product structure on the hexahedron which allows for fast integration algorithms. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical predictions stating that for smooth problems an exponential convergence rate is obtained under pure p-refinement. For other types of problems at least algebraic rates of convergence are achieved. Furthermore, different discretizations of the shape functions used for the Lagrangian multipliers on the in- terface of the two structures are investigated. Here, non-continuous ansatz spaces produce the best results for the examples under investigation. Even for nonlinear material behaviour a numerical experiment provides a sound indication of the robust properties of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Contact modeling is still one of the most difficult aspects of non-linear implicit structural analysis. Most 3D contact algorithms employed today use node-on-segment approaches for contacting dissimilar meshes. Two pass node-on-segment contact approaches have the well known deficiency of locking due to over-constraint. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a segment-to-segment contact approach based on the mortar method. By eliminating the over-constraint, this method appears to be much more robust than the node-on-segment approach. Furthermore, node-on-segment approaches suffer when individual nodes slide out of contact at contact surface boundaries or when contacting nodes slide from facet to facet. This causes jumps in the contact forces due to the discrete nature of the constraint enforcement and difficulties in convergence for implicit solution techniques. These jumps in forces are avoided in the segment-to-segment approach, since penetration is measured by the occluded weighted volume which varies smoothly with perturbations.
Until now, all mortar schemes have been developed for small deformation/sliding and have mainly been applied on flat surfaces. Here we will present the integration scheme and the linearization approach used for handling the contact surface integrals in the event of large sliding. The schemes are designed to conserve linear momentum and can be applied to arbitrarily curved 3D surfaces. Although expensive, our numerical examples demonstrate that the approach is far more robust than even smoothed node-on-segment contact techniques. That is, problems previously not solvable with node-on-segment can now be solved with our segment-to-segment contact.},

and hence allows for the numerical solution of a partial differential equation on
a domain Ω without the necessary evil of finding a suitable mesh first. For thin
walled structures it is known to behave ill-conditioned and to yield inaccurate
solutions, most likely due to it’s particular susceptibility towards errors in the
numerical evaluation of the integral expressions. The objective of this thesis is to
introduce a precise integration scheme applicable to a specific, simple test case
for a 2D linear elastic problem and to subsequently study the behaviour and
convergence properties of the Finite Cell Method. Eventually a prospect is given
which strategies could be pursued in the future to enable the reliable disposition
of the Finite Cell Method for thin walled structures.},

The superconvergent recovery technique developed in the first part of the paper1 is the used in the computation of the Zienkiewicz–Zhu error estimator to demonstrate accurate estimation of the exact error attainable. Numerical tests are shown for various element types illustrating the excellent effectivity of the error estimator in the energy norm and pointwise gradient (stress) error estimation. Several examples of the performance of the error estimator in adaptive mesh refinement are also presented.},

The largest group are variants of the h-version of the finite element method (h-{FEM}), where low order Ansatz functions are used. By contrast, we3 investigate a combination of high order {FEM} and a fictitious domain approach, the finite cell method ({FCM}). While the {FCM} has been verified and valiyeard in previous publications, this article proposes methods on how the {FCM} can be made computationally efficient to the extent that it can be used for patient specific, interactive bone simulations. This approach is called computational steering and allows to change input parameters like the position of an implant, material or loads and leads to an almost instantaneous change in the output (stress lines, deformations). This direct feedback gives the user an immediate impression of the impact of his actions to an extent which, otherwise, is hard to obtain by the use of classical non interactive computations. Specifically, we investigate an application to pre-surgical planning of a total hip replacement where it is desirable to select an optimal implant for a specific patient. Herein, optimal is meant in the sense that the expected post-operative stress distribution in the bone closely resembles that before the operation.},

First, the {EFG} algorithm for a one-dimensional problem in linear elastostatics is given; the results are compared to those achievable with standard finite element techniques. A step by step explanation of the {MATLAB} program used to solve the problem is given with specific references to the {EFG} method in one-dimension. Next, a simplified two-dimensional implementation to linear elastostatics is described. Results are calculated with the method and the aid of a two-dimensional {MATLAB} {EFG} program, and conclusions are drawn about the method and its capabilities. The source programs used to solve both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems are provided in the Appendices and are available on the web.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a strategy to parameterize contact surfaces of arbitrary mesh topology in 3D with at least C1-continuity for both quadrilateral and triangular meshes. In the regular mesh domain, four quadrilaterals or six triangles meet in one node, even C2-continuity is attained. Therefore, we use subdivision surfaces, for which non-physical pressure jumps are avoided for contact interactions. They are usually present when the contact kinematics is based on facet elements discretizing the interacting bodies. The properties of subdivision surfaces give rise to basically four different implementation strategies. Each strategy has specific features and requires more or less efforts for an implementation in a finite element program. One strategy is superior with respect to the others in the sense that it does not use nodal degrees of freedom of the finite element mesh at the contact surface. Instead, it directly uses the degrees of freedom of the smooth surface. Thereby, remarkably, it does not require an interpolation. We show how the proposed method can be used to parameterize adaptively refined meshes with hanging nodes. This is essential when dealing with finite element models whose geometry is generated by means of subdivision techniques. Three numerical 3D problems demonstrate the improved accuracy, robustness and performance of the proposed method over facet-based contact surfaces. In particular, the third problem, adopted from biomechanics, shows the advantages when designing complex contact surfaces by means of subdivision techniques.

	title = {The finite cell method for solute transport problems in porous media},
	abstract = {Simulating a solute transport problem in a heterogeneous porous media requires considerable computational effort especially when refined boundary conforming meshes become necessary. The finite cell method, which combines a fictitious domain approach and the high order finite element method, was recently developed for solid mechanics and allows a trivial mesh generation regardless of the possibly complicated geometry. In this contribution, the finite cell method is generalized to solute transport problems in fluid mechanics. The non-smooth problem occurs due to discontinuous material coefficients, i.e. porosity, within the cell being cut by the boundary of the original domain. This problem can be resolved by generating non-uniform sub-cells based on the adaptive integration scheme or by increasing the number of integration points on the cell level. As a validation of our approach, a benchmark problem is solved for a single component solute transport problem. Additionally, the method is extended to multi-component reactive transport problems. A comparison of the convergence rate between the classical finite element method and the finite cell method will be given.},

Mesh generation for a boundary representation of solids and for voxel-based data obtained from {CT} scans is addressed in detail. In addition, the implementation of non-homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and the computation of cell matrices based on a composed integration is presented.

The approach was illustrated on a simple example of an elastic bar in dynamics. In a companion paper [2], the structure of the proposed environment was described at length. In this article, the key features of the automatic generation of finite elements in a symbolic object-oriented environment are given. A few examples of derivation and automatic programming are developed and numerically tested. First, a classical Galerkin formulation of Stokes flow is compared to a Galerkin least-squares stabilization formulation. Then, various stabilized formulations are tested on a simple scalar diffusion model equation.},

The study is a part of long-term project on bone remodelling which drives bone microstructure change based directly on trabeculae surface energy. The proposed approach is based on a first-order computational homogenization technique. The coincidence of macro- and micro-model kinematics is done with the use of uniform displacement and traction boundary conditions. The computational homogenization procedure is driven by a self-prepared manager which is coded in Python. The computation on real bone structure (a piece of female Wistar rat bone) is performed as well.},

Solutions are calculated using Galerkin's method with a piecewise bilinear basis in space and backward Euler integration in time. A posteriori estimates of the local discretization error of piecewise bilinear finite element solutions are obtained by a p-refinement technique. These error estimates are used to control a local h-refinement strategy where finer grids are recursively introduced in regions where a prescribed tolerance is exceeded. Fine grids at a given level of refinement may overlap each other and independent solutions are generated on each of them. A version of the Schwarz alternating principle is used to coordinate solutions between overlapping fine grids. Computational results demonstrating the performance of the adaptive procedure on linear and nonlinear problems and apparent convergence of the error estimate for linear heat conduction problem and uniform global refinement is presented.},

The h-p cloud method is applicable to arbitrary domains and employs only a scattered set of nodes to build approximate solutions to {BVPs}. This new method uses radial basis functions of varying size of supports and with polynomial-reproducing properties of arbitrary order. The approximating properties of the h-p cloud functions are investigated in this article and several theorems concerning these properties are presented. Moving least squares interpolants are used to build a partition of unity on the domain of interest. These functions are then used to construct, at a very low cost, trial and test functions for Galerkin approximations. The method exhibits a very high rate of convergence and has a greater flexibility than traditional h-p finite element methods. Several numerical experiments in 1-D and 2-D are also presented. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Hydrated and dry apparent density, ash density, and density from quantitative computed tomography ({QCT}) were determined for cubic trabecular specimens taken from the proximal portion of human tibiae, and correlations between these measures were found(r {\textgreater} 0.99, P {\textless}.001). Orthogonal moduli and strengths of the specimens were measured mechanically, and were significantly correlated with ash density according to power relations (r ≥ 0.85, P {\textless}.001). The strong correlation between density from {QCT} and ash density indicates that these measures can be used with nearly equal precision in estimating modulus and strength of tibial trabecular bone. Equations between mechanical properties and density reported in previous studies were converted to use a common density measure and, after considering the effects of specimen size, were in general agreement with results of the present study. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The constitutive theory of Isotropic thermoelasticity is first considered. The stress response and the entropy expression are derived in the case of quadratic dependence of the elastic strain energy on the finite elastic strain. Basic kinematic and kinetic aspects of the phenomenological and single crystal elastoplasticity within the framework of the multiplicative decomposition are presented. Attention is given to additive decompositions of the stress and strain rates into their elastic and plastic parts. The constitutive analysis of the stress-modulated growth of pseudo-elastic soft tissues is then presented. The elastic and growth parts of the deformation gradient and the rate of deformation tensor are defined and used to construct the corresponding rate-type biomechanic theory. The structure of the evolution equation for growth-induced stretch ratio is discussed. There are 112 references cited in this review article. 2004 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a meshfree smooth contact formulation for application to metal forming problems. The continuum-based contact formulation requires C2{\textbackslash}text \{C\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} continuity in the approximation of contact surface geometry and displacement variables, which is difficult for the conventional C0{\textbackslash}text \{C\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\} finite elements. In this work, we introduce a reproducing kernel approximation to achieve arbitrary degree of smoothness for contact surface representation and displacement field approximation. This approach allows the employment of continuum-based contact formulation, leading to a continuous contact force vector and a consistent tangent particularly advantageous in the Newton iteration of contact analysis. The proposed meshfree smooth contact formulation has been applied to the simulation of metal forming processes and is shown to improve the convergence significantly in comparison with the finite element-based C0{\textbackslash}text \{C\}{\textasciicircum}\{0\} contact formulation.},

	title = {Eulerian contact for versatile collision processing},
	url = {http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00149706/fr/},
	abstract = {We propose a new approach for collision modeling in physically based animation. Con- trary to most current approaches, our method can be used with all physical models rather than any specific class. At each time step, the geometry of the bodies is mapped to a sparse regular Eu- lerian grid. Each grid point carries a mass, a velocity and a spatial density. This grid acts as a common mechanical layer where detection, modeling and reaction to collision take place, without any assumption about the internal dynamics of the bodies in contact. Mappings are then used to propagate penalty- and constraint-based reactions back to the bodies. We show that mappings can be easily set up for the most commonly used physical models. Our approach greatly simplifies the implementation of collision modeling since we only have to consider each body’s individual map- ping to the Eulerian grid, rather than numerous model pair-specific methods. Moreover, it allows us to design and reuse efficient collision response strategies independently of the physical models. We demonstrate our method with a variety of models including rigid bodies, deformable solids and fluids.},

The {FCM} – a combination of a Fictitious Domain approach and high order Finite Elements – is an accurate computational technique for complex domains, which dispenses with the need for generating boundary conforming meshes. The high order {FEM} will be shown to stabilize the oscillation at nodal solutions introduced in convection-dominated problems. One- and two-dimensional model problems are demonstrated where exponential convergence rates are observed. The validity of the approach is studied for convection- and diffusion-dominated flows, concluding this treatise with a three-dimensional single component convection-diffusion example and a two-dimensional multi-component reactive transport problem based on a complex interior geometrical structure to emphasize the potential of this method.},

	abstract = {The use of Cartesian meshes independent of the geometry has some advantages over the traditional meshes used in the finite element method. The main advantage is that their use together with an appropriate hierarchical data structure reduces the computational cost of the finite element analysis. This improvement is based on the substitution of the traditional mesh generation process by an optimized procedure for intersecting the Cartesian mesh with the boundary of the domain and the use efficient solvers based on the hierarchical data structure. One major difficulty associated to the use of Cartesian grids is the fact that the mesh nodes do not, in general, lie over the boundary of the domain, increasing the difficulty to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed by means of the Lagrange multipliers technique. A new functional has been added to the initial formulation of the problem that has the effect of stabilizing the problem. The technique here presented allows for a simple definition of the Lagrange multipliers field that even allow us to directly condense the degrees of freedom of the Lagrange multipliers at element level.

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the imposition of Dirichlet-type conditions within the extended finite element method (X-{FEM}). This method allows one to easily model surfaces of discontinuity or domain boundaries on a mesh not necessarily conforming to these surfaces. Imposing Neumann boundary conditions on boundaries running through the elements is straightforward and does preserve the optimal rate of convergence of the background mesh (observed numerically in earlier papers). On the contrary, much less work has been devoted to Dirichlet boundary conditions for the X-{FEM} (or the limiting case of stiff boundary conditions). In this paper, we introduce a strategy to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions while preserving the optimal rate of convergence. The key aspect is the construction of the correct Lagrange multiplier space on the boundary. As an application, we suggest to use this new approach to impose precisely zero pressure on the moving resin front in resin transfer moulding ({RTM}) process while avoiding remeshing. The case of inner conditions is also discussed as well as two important practical cases: material interfaces and phase-transformation front capturing. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The finite element approximation is enriched by additional functions through the notion of partition of unity, to track material interfaces. Optimal rate of convergence is achieved with curved geometries, using linear elements and linear level set in elements. In order to accelerate the convergence, the order of approximation shape functions is increased, while keeping the same computational mesh. The level set is represented on a finer sub-mesh than the finite element mesh. A special attention to integration procedure is necessary. A new enrichment function is introduced to represent the behavior of curved material interfaces. Numerical examples including free surfaces and material interfaces in 2-D linear elasticity are presented to study convergence rates.},

	abstract = {An accurate and efficient simulation of wave propagation phenomena plays an important role in different engineering disciplines. In structural health monitoring, for example, ultrasonic guided waves are used to detect and localize damage and to assess the structural integrity of the component part under consideration. Because of the complexity of real structures, the numerical simulation of structural health monitoring systems is a computationally demanding task. Therefore, to facilitate the analysis of wave propagation phenomena, the authors propose to combine the finite cell method with the spectral element method. The ensuing novel method is referred to as the spectral cell method. Because it does not rely on body-fitted meshes, the resulting approach eliminates all discretization difficulties encountered in conventional finite element methods. Moreover, with the aid of mass lumping, it paves the way for the use of explicit time-integration algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we show that using a lumped mass matrix instead of the consistent one has no detrimental effect on the accuracy of the spectral element method. We introduce the spectral cell method in the second part, showing that, when applied to wave propagation analysis, the spectral cell method yields results comparable with other standard higher order finite element approaches.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recently the hp version of the finite element method, in which adaptivity occurs in both the size, h, of the elements and in the order, p, of the approximating piecewise polynomials, has received increasing attention. It is desirable to combine this optimal order discretization method with an optimal order algebraic solution method like multigrid. An intriguing notion is to use the values of p as the levels of a multilevel method. In this paper we present such a method, known as hp-multigrid, for high-order finite elements and hp-adaptive grids. We present a survey of the development of p-multigrid and hp-multigrid, define an hp-multigrid algorithm based on the p-hierarchical basis for the p levels and h-hierarchical basis for an h-multigrid solution of the p=1 ‘coarse grid’ equations, and present numerical convergence results using hp-adaptive grids. The numerical results suggest that the method has a convergence rate of {\textbackslash}documentclass\{article\}{\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\}{\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsbsy\}{\textbackslash}usepackage[mathscr]\{euscript\}{\textbackslash}footskip=0pc{\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\${\textbackslash}end\{document\} for Poisson's equation.

This leads to a method that is second-order accurate in space and time. For the case in which the boundary is moving, we convert the moving-boundary problem to a sequence of fixed-boundary problems, combined with an extrapolation procedure to initialize values that are uncovered as the boundary moves. We find that, in the moving boundary case, the use of Crank–Nicolson time discretization is unstable, requiring us to use the L 0 -stable implicit Runge–Kutta method of Twizell, Gumel, and Arigu (1996, Adv.

For both frameworks we derive a general variational framework for the adaptive finite element approximation of {FSI} problems. The focal points of this thesis are the comparison of the {ALE} and the novel Eulerian ap- proaches and the application of the ‘dual weighted residual’ ({DWR}) method to {FSI} prob- lems. The {DWR} method is the basis of two techniques, a posteriori error estimation and goal-oriented mesh adaptivity. Based on the developed models of {FSI} we apply the {DWR} method for a posteriori error estimation and goal-oriented mesh adaptation to {FSI} problems. Necessary aspects of {DWR} method and implementation for the {ALE} and Eulerian approach are discussed. Several stationary as well as nonstationary examples are presented using both the {ALE} as well as the Eulerian framework. Results from both frameworks are in good agreement with each other. Also for both frameworks the {DWR} method is successfully applied. Finally using benchmark results from the {DFG} joint research group {FOR} 493 (of which the author is a participating member) the discussed methods are verified for both frameworks.},

	abstract = {For the mathematically sound, cost effective, flexible and automatic computation of structural mechanical problems with error tolerances, adaptive finite element meshes (h-adaptivity) and elements with different Ansatz order (p-adaptivity) and dimension (d-adaptivity) are desirable. Furthermore, because of the numerical effort, the use of parallel computers is adequate. Object-oriented data structures and algorithms are presented which support these adaptive formulations. In this paper, we describe a refinement algorithm which adapts hexahedral meshes in a node regular way, i.e. without hanging nodes. Moreover, classes implementing the mathematical operators and structures arising in the finite element formulation are introduced within the object oriented concept. They offer the means to implement {FE} formulations in a way, very similar to the mathematical notation. For these purposes, an object-oriented language is strongly required in order to get a general and simple program structure, even for highly complex tasks with h-, p- and d-adaptivity and distributed data.},

In order to achieve convergence, the p-version leaves the mesh unchanged and increases the polynomial degree of the shape functions locally or globally, whereas the r-method moves nodes and edges of an existing {FE}-mesh. The basic idea of our rp-version approach is to adjust the finite element mesh to the shape of the elastic–plastic interface in order to take into account the loss of regularity which arises along the curve of the plastic front. Numerical examples will demonstrate that this approach leads to an exponential rate of convergence and highly accurate results.},

	abstract = {The finite element method ({FEM}) has become the most widely accepted general-purpose technique for numerical simulations in engineering and applied mathematics. Principal applications arise in continuum mechanics, fluid flow, thermodynamics, and field theory. In these areas, computational methods are essential and benefit strongly from the enormous advances in computer technology. B-splines play an important role in approximation and geometric modeling. They are used in data fitting, computer-aided design ({CAD}), automated manufacturing ({CAM}), and computer graphics.

Finite Element Methods with B-Splines describes new weighted approximation techniques, combining the computational advantages of B-splines and standard finite elements. In particular, no grid generation is necessary, which eliminates a difficult and often time-consuming preprocessing step. The meshless methods are very efficient and yield highly accurate solutions with relatively few parameters. This is illustrated for typical boundary value problems in fluid flow, heat conduction, and elasticity.

Topics discussed by the author include basic finite element theory, algorithms for B-splines, weighted bases, stability and error estimates, multigrid techniques, applications, and numerical examples. The text is essentially self-contained and easily accessible to graduate students in mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences. The new concepts are also of interest to academic researchers and to scientists in industry who are developing finite element software. Some basic facts on functional analysis and partial differential equations, which are required, are listed in the appendix.},

The contact surfaces and the underlying solids are parameterized in an identical paradigm. The use of {NURBS} geometry eliminates at the onset the geometric discontinuities induced by the traditional faceted approximation. Contact detection is carried out patch-wise, instead of element-wise, leading to an efficient and robust numerical algorithm. A strategy for smoothing sharp corners is also described. The algorithm does not rely on fillets but entails only a minor perturbation to the {NURBS} parameters. A variationally consistent surface-to-surface formulation is developed in the context of frictionless contact. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance and utility of the method.},

The fictitious domain approach consists in immersing the original domain into a larger and geometrically simpler one in order to avoid the use of boundary fitted or unstructured meshes. In the present study, boundary constraints are enforced using Lagrange multipliers and the novel aspect is that the Lagrange multipliers are associated with smooth forcing functions, compactly supported inside the fictitious domain. This allows the accuracy of the spectral method to be preserved, unlike the classical discrete Lagrange multipliers method, in which the forcing is defined on the boundaries. In order to have a robust and efficient method, equations for the Lagrange multipliers are solved directly with an influence matrix technique. Using a Fourier–Chebyshev approximation, the high-order accuracy of the method is demonstrated on one- and two-dimensional elliptic problems of second- and fourth-order. The principle of the method is general and can be applied to solve elliptic problems using any high order variational approximation.},

It is based on a non-standard variational formulation due to Nitsche and leads to a matrix formulation in the primary variables. The method modifies the unconstrained functional by adding extra terms and a stabilization which is related to the classical penalty method. These new terms are characterized by the presence of contact forces that are computed from the stresses in the continuum elements. They can be seen as a sort of Lagrangian-type contributions. Due to the computation of the contact forces from the continuum elements, some additional degrees-of-freedom are involved in the stiffness matrix parts related to contact. These degrees-of-freedom are associated with nodes not belonging to the contact surfaces.},

On the thermomechanical side, novel aspects of the proposed model of thermoplasticity are (1) the explicit characterization of the plastic (configurational) entropy as an independent internal variable, (2) a thermomechanical extension of the principle of maximum dissipation consistent with the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, and (3) the exploitation of this extended principle in the formulation of an associative flow which characterizes the evolution of the plastic entropy in terms of the change of the flow criterion with respect to temperature. On the numerical analysis side, salient features of the proposed approach are (4) a new global product formula algorithm constructed via an operator split of the nonlinear initial value problem, which leads to a two-step solution procedure, (5) a unified class of local return mapping algorithms which preserves exactly the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow and reduces to the classical radial return method for isothermal J2-flow theory, and (6) the formulation of a mixed finite element method in terms of the elastic entropy and the temperature field which circumvents well-known difficulties associated with the incompressibility constraint on the plastic flow. The exact linearization of both the product formula algorithm and an alternative simulataneous solution scheme for the coupled thermomechanical problem is given in two appendices.},

tations with high order finite element methods. It presents approaches for the
generation of triangular and quadrilateral elements on curved surface models and
for the generation of tetrahedral and hexahedral elements on solid models of dif-
ferent types.
Firstly it introduces the fundamental aspects of geometric modelling and the fi-
nite element method of high order. It focuses on a concept for describing curved
elements to best cover the exact shape of the underlying geometry. Subsequently,
the architecture of a framework-software which serves as a foundation for the
developed meshing techniques is outlined. The generation of finite element mes-
hes with high element quality on arbitrary curved surface models is achieved by
coupling the recursive subdivision technique with mathematical methods of diffe-
rential geometry. Based on this a strategy for generation of tetrahedral elements
for indirect solid models is shown. Finally, a method for generation of hexahedral
elements on complex thin-walled structures is presented and its suitability for
practical use is demonstrated in several examples.},

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to solve second-order elliptic problems in an original physical domain using a fictitious domain method with a spread interface approach . The main idea of the fictitious domain approach consists in immersing the original domain of study into a geometrically bigger and simpler one called fictitious domain. As the spatial discretization is being performed in the fictitious domain, this method allows the use of structured meshes. The discretization is not boundary-fitted to the original physical domain. This paper describes several ways to impose Dirichlet, Robin or Neumann boundary conditions on a spread immersed interface, without locally modifying the numerical scheme and without using Lagrange multipliers. The numerical applications focus on diffusion and convection problems in the unit disk, with Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions. For such problems, analyt- ical solutions can be determined for a correctly chosen source term. The numerical resolution is performed using a Q1 Finite Element scheme. The spread interface ap- proach is then combined with a local adaptive mesh refinement algorithm in order to increase the precision in the vinicity of the immersed boundary. The L2 norm of the errors is computed in order to evaluate the capability of the method. Immersed boundaries are found in many industrial applications like two-phase flow simulations, fluid/ structure interaction, etc. This article represents a first step towards the simulation of these kinds of applications},

	abstract = {A new method for the solution of the standard eigenvalue problem with large symmetric profile matrices is presented. The method is based on the well-known {QR}-method for dense matrices. A new, flexible and reliable extension of the method is developed that is highly suited for the independent computation of any set of eigenvalues. In order to analyze the weak convergence of the method in the presence of clustered eigenvalues, the {QR}-method is studied. Two effective, stable and numerically cheap extensions are introduced to overcome the troublesome stagnation of the convergence. A repeated preconditioning process in combination with Jacobi rotations in the parts of the matrix with the strongest convergence is developed to significantly improve both local and global convergence. The extensions preserve the profile structure of the matrix. The efficiency of the new method is demonstrated with several examples. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The scatter of experimental results may be one reason for difficulties in interpretation. Apart from analytical approaches, which often seen inadequate to deal with the peculiar complexities of the problem, numerical techniques are reliable and can lead to significant results. In this work, a formulation based on the finite element method is described, adopting a nonlinear model with hyperelastic material configuration. Particular attention is paid to modelling the material constituting the nucleus, involving incompressibility characteristics and avoiding simulation techniques. This approach allows the mechanical behaviour of the real configuration of the disc to be investigated and also provides a reliable analysis of disc degeneration phenomena. The theoretical and operational aspects of the formulation are reported. The results obtained are compared with responses from various numerical and experimental data.},

The stability of these elements, however, cannot be guaranteed for general deformation states and arbitrarily
shaped elements. In order to overcome this deÿciency, we develop an innovative control technique based
on a modal analysis on element level. The control is completely automatic in the sense that no artiÿcial
factors are introduced. The computational e ort is negligible. The key to the approach is the split of the
element tangent matrix into constant and hourglass parts which is not possible for the classical enhanced
strain concept in general. This motivates the use of a recently developed reduced integration method, which,
since its stabilization part is derived on the basis of the enhanced strain method, shows the same performance
and retains the crucial split. Using this formulation in combination with the new control technique, leads to
a ‘smart’ element which is free of hourglass instabilities and generally applicable, also for strongly distorted
meshes. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient, hierarchical high-order enrichment approach for the finite cell method applied to problems of solid mechanics involving discontinuities and singularities. In contrast to the standard extended finite element method, where new degrees of freedom are introduced for all finite elements located in the enrichment zone, we define the enrichment on a so-called overlay mesh which is superimposed over the base mesh. The approximation on the base mesh is obtained by means of the finite cell method where the hp-d method is employed to introduce the hierarchical extension on the overlay mesh. We present two different strategies for defining the enrichment on the superimposed overlay mesh. In the first approach, the enrichment is based on a local h-, p- or hp-refinement utilizing the finite element method on the overlay mesh. Alternatively, the enrichment is constructed by means of the partition of unity method introducing carefully selected enrichment functions suitable for the problem at hand. Our results reveal that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the finite cell method significantly with only a minimum number of additional degrees of freedom. In this paper we will focus on examples with material interfaces although the method can also be applied to problems involving strong discontinuities and singularities. Accurate stress distribution and an exponential rate of convergence are the two striking characteristics of the proposed method. Due to the hierarchical approach it paves the way to using different approaches for the approximation on the base and the overlay mesh and accordingly allows multiscale problems to be addressed as well.},

Unlike the existing adaptive techniques, where either the mesh is refined (h-version), or the polynomial order is increased (p-version), or a combination of both (h−p version), the s-version increases the resolution by superimposing additional mesh(es) of higher-order hierarchical elements. C0 continuity of the displacement field is maintained by imposing homogeneous boundary conditions on the superimposed field in the portion of the boundary which is not contained within the boundary of the problem. The superimposed regions can be of arbitrary shape, unlimited by the problem geometry, boundary conditions and the underlying mesh topography.

proposed by H.E. Hinnant. Focussing on the quadrature of finite-element matrices, arising from
higher order discretizations, we outline a modified vector integration, which leads to a significant speed-up, even in case of strongly distorted elements. The method has been implemented
in an existing -version finite-element code and its efficiency is demonstrated by numerical examples.},

	abstract = {An s-adaptive finite element procedure is developed for the transient analysis of 2-D solid mechanics problems with material non-linearity due to progressive damage. The resulting adaptive method simultaneously estimates and controls both the spatial error and temporal error within user-specified tolerances. The spatial error is quantified by the Zienkiewicz–Zhu error estimator and computed via superconvergent patch recovery, while the estimation of temporal error is based on the assumption of a linearly varying third-order time derivatives of the displacement field in conjunction with direct numerical time integration. The distinguishing characteristic of the s-adaptive procedure is the use of finite element mesh superposition (s-refinement) to provide spatial adaptivity. Mesh superposition proves to be particularly advantageous in computationally demanding non-linear transient problems since it is faster, simpler and more efficient than traditional h-refinement schemes. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance characteristics of the s-adaptive method for quasi-static and transient problems with material non-linearity.

The boundary data transfer at the contact zone is essential for the algorithm. It is realized by a scaled mass matrix which results from the mortar discretization on non-matching triangulations. We apply a nonlinear block Gauss–Seidel method as iterative solver which can be interpreted as a Dirichlet–Neumann algorithm for the nonlinear problem. In each iteration step, we have to solve a linear Neumann problem and a nonlinear Signorini problem. The solution of the Signorini problem is realized in terms of monotone multigrid methods.

Based on the theory of anisotropic elasticity and Lekhnitskii’s complex-variable stress function formulation, the exact laminate elasticity solution is derived for the problem. The solution contains the exact boundary-layer stress singularity and higher-order terms in eigenfunction series. Convergence and accuracy of the solution are studied, and present results are compared with existing approximate numerical solutions. For illustrative purposes, the complete solution for a symmetric [45/−45 / −45/45] graphite-epoxy composite is presented to eluciyear fundamental characteristics of the boundary-layer effects. Detailed stress distributions in the boundary-layer region are determined. Boundary-layer stress intensity factors are introduced to characterize the singular edge-stress field. Physical significance of the parameters is discussed in the realm of fracture initiation and failure modes in the laminate boundary region.},

Young’s modulus of the graded intermediate layer is assumed to be an arbitrary function of the thickness coordinate and its Poisson’s ratio is kept a constant. The solution can easily degenerate into the ones of the tri-material beam, the bi-material beam, the homogeneous beam, and the graded beam, and some of them coincide with the available solutions. The analytical and numerical (finite-element-based) results are in agreement with each other for several examples. The influence on the stress distribution for the cantilever beam is discussed when Young’s modulus of the graded intermediate layer takes different functions.},

	abstract = {This work presents a systematic approach to incorporate microstructural changes in the
constitutive modeling of the macroscopic material behavior. In particular we consider
materials that are in its virgin state isotropic and develop a microstructure as a conse-
quence of mechanical or thermal loading. To provide purely heuristic theories with a
more refined background a mesoscopic theory will be introduced. Mesoscopic theories
fall somewhere in between microscopic and macroscopic theories in the sense that no
microscopic interactions between atoms and molecules are considered. Rather meso-
scopic field equations contain additional variables which have to do with microstructural
changes of the material.
The focus of this work is on modeling the material in a way that enables a numerical
computation of engineering or biological structures. Special emphasis is put on dynam-
ically loaded structures undergoing large deformations. The theoretical framework is
based on (local and instantaneous) energy-minimizing principles. In consequence, the
presented algorithms for numerical simulations are strictly variational. Exemplarily the
fragmentation of ductile metal structures, the assessment of damage in microelectronic
components and the shock wave induced damage in a human kidney are analyzed.},

	abstract = {This review article has two parts, published in separate issues of this journal, which consider the stress singularities that occur in linear elastostatics. In the present Part I, after a brief review of the singularities that attend concentrated loads, attention is focused on the singularities that occur away from such loading, and primarily on 2D configurations. A number of examples of these singularities are given in the Introduction. For all of these examples, it is absolutely essential that the presence of singularities at least be recognized if the stress fields are to be used in attempts to ensure structural integrity. Given an appreciation of a stress singularity’s occurrence, there are two options open to the stress analyst if the stress analysis is to actually be used. First, to try and improve the modeling so that the singularity is removed and physically sensible stresses result. Second, to try and interpret singularities that persist in a physically meaningful way. Section 2 of the paper reviews avenues available for the removal of stress singularities. At this time, further research is needed to effect the removal of all singularities. Section 3 of the paper reviews possible interpretations of singularities. At this time, interpretations using the singularity coefficient, or stress intensity factor, would appear to be the best available. To implement an approach using stress intensity factors in a general context, two types of companion analysis are usually required: analytical asymptotics to characterize local singular fields; and numerical analysis to capture participation in global configurations. Section 4 of the paper reviews both types of analysis. At this time, methods for both are fairly well developed. Studies in the literature which actually effect asymptotic analyses of specific singular configurations will be considered in Part {II} of this review article. The present Part I has 182 references.},

	abstract = {An extension of the Generalized Finite Element Method ({GFEM}) is proposed with which we efficiently reduce approximation errors. The new method constructs a stiffness matrix with a conditioning that is significantly better than the Stable Generalized Finite Element Method ({SGFEM}) and the Finite Element Method ({FEM}). Accordingly, the risk of a severe loss of accuracy in the computed solution, which burdens the {GFEM}, is prevented. Furthermore, the computational cost of the inversion of the associated stiffness matrix is significantly reduced. The {GFEM} employs a set of enriched basis functions which is chosen to improve the rate at which the approximation converges to the exact solution. The stiffness matrix constructed from these basis functions is often ill-conditioned and the accuracy of the solution cannot be guaranteed. We prevent this by orthonormalizing the basis functions and refer to the method as the Orthonormalized Generalized Finite Element Method ({OGFEM}). Because the {OGFEM} has the flexibility to orthonormalize either a part or all of the basis functions, the method can be considered as a generalization of the {GFEM}. The method is applicable with single or multiple global and/or local enrichment functions. Problems in blending elements are avoided by a modification of the enrichment functions. The method is demonstrated for the one-dimensional modified Helmholtz and Poisson equations and compared with the {FEM}, {GFEM} and {SGFEM}.},

Within a setting where the {NURBS} discretization of the contact surface is inherited directly from the {NURBS} discretization of the volume, the contact integrals are evaluated through a mortar approach where the geometrical and frictional contact constraints are treated through a projection to control point quantities. The formulation delivers a non-negative pressure distribution and minimally oscillatory local contact interactions with respect to alternative Lagrange discretizations independent of the discretization order. These enable the achievement of improved smoothness in global contact forces and moments through higher-order geometrical descriptions. It is concluded that the presented mortar-based approach serves as a common basis for treating isogeometric contact problems with varying orders of discretization throughout the contact surface and the volume.},

	abstract = {The correlation between bone mineral density and vertebral strength is not based on mechanical principles and thus the method cannot reflect the effects of subtle geometric features and densitometric inhomogeneities that may substantially affect vertebral strength. Finite element models derived from quantitative computed tomography ({QCT}) scans overcome such limitations. The overall goal of this study was to establish that {QCT}-based “voxel” finite element models are better predictors of vertebral compressive strength than {QCT} measures of bone mineral density with or without measures of cross-sectional area. {QCT} scans were taken of 13 vertebral bodies excised from 13 cadavers (L1–L4; age: 37–87 years; M = 6, F = 7) and used to calculate bone mineral density ({BMDQCT}). The {QCT} voxel data were converted into linearly elastic finite element models of each vertebra, from which measures of vertebral stiffness and strength were computed. The vertebrae were biomechanically tested in compression to measure strength. Vertebral strength was positively correlated with the finite element measures of strength (r2 = 0.86, P \&lt; 0.0001) and stiffness (r2 = 0.82, P \&lt; 0.0001), the product of {BMDQCT} and vertebral minimum cross-sectional area (r2 = 0.65, P = 0.0008), and {BMDQCT} alone (r2 = 0.53, P = 0.005). These results demonstrate that highly automated “voxel” finite element models are superior to correlation-based {QCT} methods in predicting vertebral compressive strength and therefore offer great promise for improvement of clinical fracture risk assessment.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new numerical integration technique for 3D contact finite element implementations, focusing on a remedy for the inaccurate integration due to discontinuities at the boundary of contact surfaces. The method is based on the adaptive refinement of the integration domain along the boundary of the contact surface, and is accordingly denoted {RBQ} for refined boundary quadrature. It can be used for common element types of any order, e.g. Lagrange, {NURBS}, or T-Spline elements. In terms of both computational speed and accuracy, {RBQ} exhibits great advantages over a naive increase of the number of quadrature points. Also, the {RBQ} method is shown to remain accurate for large deformations. Furthermore, since the sharp boundary of the contact surface is determined, it can be used for various purposes like the accurate post-processing of the contact pressure. Several examples are presented to illustrate the new technique.},

After formulating the problem of two bonded anisotropic wedges, the stress singularity near the free edge of two bonded layers, at the tip of a crack between two materials and in the vicinity of a broken layer is obtained by simply varying the wedge angles. It is shown that, the power of singularity depends on the elastic properties of the anisotropic constituents. Several examples occurring in real layered composites structures and illustrating this fact are studied in some detail. Unlike the isotropic case the power of singularity at the tip of a crack between two materials can be real.},

	title = {Exact Modelling of Stress Fields In Bimaterial Beams Using Readily Available Mathematical Software},
	doi = {10.1109/ESIME.2006.1644036},
	abstract = {A little-used first principles solution was proposed by Hess in 1969 for the stress fields in a bimaterial elastic beam under any arbitrary self equilibrating free end loading. In this paper Hess's solution is implemented using Matlab to calculate axial and normal stresses at any required horizontal or vertical cross-section of the beam. The approach uses numerical methods to develop an eigenvalue solution for any given set of layer thicknesses and material properties. A novel finite element mesh design, originally presented in 1989 by Schiermeier and Szabo, is used to valiyear the results from the above analysis. The mesh (of p-elements) is strongly graded around singularities, ensuring their effects are isolated. More remote areas of the model, where stresses and gradients are low, are sparsely populated by elements. The rapid changes in interfacial peeling stress and interfacial shear stress close to the free edge are coped with quite effectively by this mesh design. The two methods are used to examine the stress fields in the bimaterial beam. Although both methods can be used to calculate stresses at any required horizontal or vertical cross-section in the beam, the first principles method has the advantage of not requiring {FEA} software. Instead Excel or Matlab can readily display a plot of the stress distribution in the selected cross section. The method can be applied to axial, shear and peeling (normal) stresses in bimaterial beams. The solution has applications in many varied areas of engineering, from thermal stresses in {IC} packages to the behaviour of armour plating under mechanical loads},

Because a mathematical interlaminar stress singularity is expected between the 0 ° and 90 ° plies at the hole, the computed normal stress σz and the shear stress τz0 are presented near but not at the hole edge. There is good qualitative agreement on τz0 but the {FE} results are considerably higher by a ratio of between 3 and 5 than those predicted by the Ko-Lin analysis. For σz, again the {FE} values are considerably higher, but there is also poor qualitative agreement.

The scope of this paper is restricted to models of the vertebra, the intervertebral disc and short spinal segments. In the case of single vertebral models, specimen-specific methods have been developed, which allow direct validation against experimental tests. The focus of intervertebral disc modelling has been on representing the complex material properties and further sensitivity testing is required to fully understand the relative roles of these input parameters. In order to construct complex multi-component short segment models, many geometric and material parameters are required, some of which are yet to be fully characterised. There are also major challenges in terms of short segment model validation. Throughout the review, areas of good practise are highlighted and recommendations for future development are proposed, taking a step towards more robust spinal modelling procedures, promoting acceptance from the wider biomechanics community.},

This study employed topology optimization to design a new cage and analyze stress distribution of the lumbar spine from L1 to L3 with a new cage by using the commercial software {ANSYS} 6.0. A total of three finite element models, namely the intact lumbar spine, the spine with double {RF} cages, and with double new cages, were established. The loading conditions were that 10 N m flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion, respectively, were imposed on the superior surface of the L1 vertebral body. The bottom of the L3 vertebral body was constrained completely.

The {FEM} estimated that the new cage not only could be reduced to 36\% of the volume of the present {RF} cage but was also similar in biomechanical performance such as range of motion, stress of adjacent disc, and lower subsidence to the {RF} cage. The advantage of the new cage was that the increased space allowed more bone graft to be placed and the cage saved material. The disadvantage was that stress of the new cage was greater than that of the {RF} cage.},

	abstract = {Mortar finite element methods provide a very convenient and powerful discretization framework for geometrically nonlinear applications in computational contact mechanics, because they allow for a variationally consistent treatment of contact conditions (mesh tying, non-penetration, frictionless or frictional sliding) despite the fact that the underlying contact surface meshes are non-matching and possibly also geometrically non-conforming. However, one of the major issues with regard to mortar methods is the design of adequate numerical integration schemes for the resulting interface coupling terms, i.e. curve integrals for 2D contact problems and surface integrals for 3D contact problems. The way how mortar integration is performed crucially influences the accuracy of the overall numerical procedure as well as the computational efficiency of contact evaluation. Basically, two different types of mortar integration schemes, which will be termed as segment-based integration and element-based integration here, can be found predominantly in the literature. While almost the entire existing literature focuses on either of the two mentioned mortar integration schemes without questioning this choice, the intention of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased comparison. The theoretical aspects covered here include the choice of integration rule, the treatment of boundaries of the contact zone, higher-order interpolation and frictional sliding. Moreover, a new hybrid scheme is proposed, which beneficially combines the advantages of segment-based and element-based mortar integration. Several numerical examples are presented for a detailed and critical evaluation of the overall performance of the different schemes within several well-known benchmark problems of computational contact mechanics.},

	abstract = {The explicit residual-based error estimator originally proposed by Babuška and Miller (1987) for adaptive finite element analysis with application to problems of linear elasticity and fracture is known to be one of the most simple and inexpensive error estimators. Indeed, it provides a theoretically guaranteed upper bound on a discretization error, measured in the energy norm, and requires small (nearly negligible) post-processing computational effort. The main issue with this classical estimator, however, is that an upper error bound is explicitly computable up to an unknown multiplicative constant. In this paper, we track the source of this generic constant, revise the original derivation procedure and derive analytically four pre-computable constants that constitute an upper error bound, resulting in, what we then call, the constant-free error estimator of the Babuška-Miller type. The performance of this constant-free estimator, as well as an adaptive {FEM} based on it, are illustrated on regular and singular benchmark problems and on numerical examples featuring crack propagation. The special property of the estimator is a sharp upper bound of the error: effectivity indices in the range of 1.2–2.0 are obtained, what is treated as practically (very) acceptable. In terms of efficiency judged against simplicity and inexpensiveness, the proposed constant-free explicit estimator is superior to, for example, corresponding implicit residual estimators and may be seen as a very competitive one in comparison with other known, yet more intricate and complex error estimation techniques.

Its main idea is the extension of the hphp - dd -method such that it allows for high-order overlay meshes yielding a hierarchical, multi-level hphp -formulation of the Finite Element Method. This concept enables intuitive refinement and coarsening procedures, while linear independence and compatibility of the shape functions are guaranteed by construction. The proposed method is demonstrated to achieve exponential rates of convergence—both in terms of degrees of freedom and in run-time—for problems with non-smooth solutions. Furthermore, the scheme is used alongside the Finite Cell Method to simulate the heat flow around moving objects on a non-conforming background mesh and is combined with an energy-based refinement indicator for automatic hphp -adaptivity.},

	abstract = {The Finite Cell Method is an immersed boundary method combined with higher order finite
elements. In {FCM}, the material parameters of the fictitious domain are scaled down, thus
a discontinuity is introduced in the cut finite cells. This introduces an error in the integrals
of the stiffness matrix. Typically, composed Gaussian quadrature for evaluating integrals in
the cut cells is used, based on a spacetree decomposition. The drawback of the spacetree
decomposition is that it introduces a high number of quadrature points and yields only a
0 th order aproximation of the geometry. The thesis proposes a different apporach to deal
with integration: the cut cells are decomposed into quadrilaterals and triangles with curved
sides and the quadrature points are distributed on their parameter spaces. To this end, an
algorithm is proposed that performs this decomposition in two dimensions. The algorithm is
able to work on complex geometries. The results show that the blended subcell integration is
able to produce results with higher precision yet still less integration points than the spacetree
approach. Thus, the overall computational effort of {FCM} analyses is considerably reduced in
comparison to the spacetree integration. This makes the proposed approach a good fit into
the design-through-analysis pipeline.},

The methodology is based on a minimization of the projection-based interpolation error with a fixed number of degrees-of-freedom. A (coarse) grid is first uniformly refined in both h and p to yield a corresponding fine grid. A two-grid solver is used to solve the problem on the fine grid or iterate towards the fine grid solution. The fine grid solution (possibly partially converged) serves then as a reference solution to be interpolated on the original coarse mesh, and the next, optimal coarse grid to be determined. The difference between the coarse and fine grid solutions provides an excellent error estimate for the coarse grid error. The procedure is repeated, with the coarse and fine meshes generated during the adaptive process simultaneously, until a prescribed error tolerance for the coarse grid error is met. The solution obtained on the last fine grid is considered to be the final product delivered by the adaptive procedure.},

Since each build-up layer consists of hundreds of scan vectors, it is impracticable to model and execute a transient thermo-mechanical simulation without appropriate simplifications.

	abstract = {In the current paper we present a fast, reliable technique for simulating wave propagation in complex structures made of heterogeneous materials. The proposed approach, the spectral cell method, is a combination of the finite cell method and the spectral element method that significantly lowers preprocessing and computational expenditure. The spectral cell method takes advantage of explicit time-integration schemes coupled with a diagonal mass matrix to reduce the time spent on solving the equation system. By employing a fictitious domain approach, this method also helps to eliminate some of the difficulties associated with mesh generation. Besides introducing a proper, specific mass lumping technique, we also study the performance of the low-order and high-order versions of this approach based on several numerical examples. Our results show that the high-order version of the spectral cell method together requires less memory storage and less {CPU} time than other possible versions, when combined simultaneously with explicit time-integration algorithms. Moreover, as the implementation of the proposed method in available finite element programs is straightforward, these properties turn the method into a viable tool for practical applications such as structural health monitoring [1–3], quantitative ultrasound applications [4], or the active control of vibrations and noise [5, 6].},

Its analysis requires a stochastic imperfection model, which can be derived either by the simple variation of the critical eigenmode with a scalar random variable, or with the help of the more advanced theory of random fields. The present paper first provides a concise review of the two different modeling approaches, covering theoretical background, assumptions and calibration, and illustrates their integration into commercial finite element software to conduct stochastic buckling analyses with the Monte–Carlo method. The stochastic buckling behavior of an example beam is then simulated with both stochastic models, calibrated from corresponding imperfection measurements. The simulation results show that for different load cases, the response statistics of the buckling load obtained with the eigenmode-based and the random field-based models agree very well. A comparison of our simulation results with corresponding Eurocode 3 limit loads indicates that the design standard is very conservative for compression dominated load cases.},

	abstract = {Formulation of isogeometric finite elements has received a great deal of attention in the recent past. The present study deals with the treatment of problems in structural mechanics including large elastic deformations and contact. One decisive difference between isogeometric finite elements, based on {NURBS} functions and standard finite elements ({FE}), based on Lagrange polynomials, is higher inter-element continuity. This is a promising characteristics to model contact problems, as all issues associated with kinks between elements are naturally avoided. Particularly in cases with large sliding this has the potential to be an attractive feature. We present a bilateral isogeometric collocation contact formulation for geometrically non-linear two-dimensional problems, using Greville and Botella points to collocate the contact integrals. Different methods to obtain accurate and physically meaningful stress distributions are investigated and compared. The results show that the higher inter-element continuity, in context of non-smooth problems, may imply undesired effects in the numerical solution such as unphysical stress oscillations. Similar effects have been observed in standard p-{FEM}. Numerical experiments indicate that these oscillations may be avoided if the basis functions of contact and non-contact zones are separated by knot relocation and knot repetition.},

	abstract = {Huge effort has been spent over the past decades to develop efficient numerical methods for topology optimization of mechanical structures. Most recent investigations have focused on increasing the efficiency and robustness, improving the optimization schemes and extending them to multidisciplinary objective functions. The vast majority of available methods is based on low order finite elements, assuming one element as the smallest entity which can be assigned material in the optimization process. Whereas the present paper uses only a very simple, heuristic optimization procedure, it investigates in detail the feasibility of high order elements for topology optimization. The Finite Cell Method, an extension of the p-version of {FEM} is used, which completely separates between the description of the geometry of a structure and cells, where the high order shape functions are defined. Whereas geometry is defined on a (very) fine mesh, the material grid, shape functions live on a much coarser grid of elements, the finite cells. The method takes advantage of the ability of high order elements to accurately approximate even strongly inhomogeneous material distribution within one element and thus boundaries between material and void which pass through the interior of the coarse cells. Very attractive properties of the proposed method can be observed: Due to the high order approach the stress field in the optimized structure is approximated very accurately, no checkerboarding is observed, the iteratively found boundary of the structure is very smooth and the observed number of iterations is in general very small.},

The algorithm is based on the minimization of the energy functional with a constraint term, formulated as in classical contact mechanics; however, instead of the distance function, we use the above-mentioned level set function.

Numerical simulation of processes is of big help to control these effects as it provides the evolution of physical quantities such as temperature, stresses and strains at any point in the structure. Simulations of single pass welding stresses give today rather satisfying results. Prediction of distortions is far much difficult as it needs 3D simulations to accurately take account of the constraining conditions induced by the weld bead. The difficulty is still increased when considering multipass welding.

This paper presents the 3D finite element simulation of multipass welding of a 316L stainless steel pipe. The whole process includes 13 weld passes and the simulation has been achieved using adaptive mesh refinements and a procedure to transport the results between the different meshes. The thermo-mechanical model used as well as the simulation methodology are detailed. Computed distortions and residual stresses are compared with experimental measurements after five passes.},

	abstract = {A new concept called analysis in computer aided design ({AiCAD}) is proposed for design-through-analysis workflow. This concept uses non-uniform rational B-Splines ({NURBS})-based B-Rep models for the entire workflow. Such models consist of trimmed {NURBS} surfaces and are considered standard in the industry, especially for modeling free-form geometries. The newly developed isogeometric B-Rep analysis ({IBRA}) used in {AiCAD} is also presented. {IBRA} can be considered as a generalization of isogeometric analysis ({IGA}) that uses the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the design model in addition to the same basis functions as in {IGA} for approximating the solution fields. {IBRA} provides the framework for creating a direct and complete analysis model from computer aided design ({CAD}) in a consistent finite-element-like manner. Thus, {IBRA} allows analyzing a {CAD} model without remodeling and meshing, even for complex geometries.

For the numerical integration of trimmed surfaces, the concept of nested Jacobian approach ({NEJA}) with {NURBS} surfaces is introduced. In addition, for enforcing the different types of boundary conditions or mechanical entities, a new finite element type called isogeometric B-Rep element is introduced. Elements of this type permit enforcing, e.g., coupling or Dirichlet boundary conditions. A corresponding formulation based on a penalty approach is presented as well.

The proposed workflow is realized exemplarily for surface modeling and the geometrical nonlinear analysis of shell structures. The differences between the standard analysis procedure and the {AiCAD} workflow are explained in detail. Various numerical examples confirm the accuracy, flexibility, and robustness of the proposed {IBRA} concept, thus highlighting its advantages for the realization of design-through-analysis workflow with a uniform geometry representation.},

In this study we investigated whether the presence of nonresorbable, osteoconductive hydroxyapatite ({HA}) particles could help maintain a denser and more functional peri-implant bone structure. Titanium screws were implanted into the proximal tibial metaphysis of four months old, ovariectomized Wistar rats (n = 60). In the right tibia, the drill hole was first filled with {HA} particles, while the left tibia served as a control without {HA} particles. Histological analysis demonstrated that during the remodelling phase the amount of newly formed bone was significantly higher on the {HA} over the control side. Micro-{CT} analysis corroborated the significant changes over time as well as differences in peri-implant bone volume density between treatment and control group. Mechanical tests demonstrated that the pull-out force was greater with {HA} particles. These results indicate that {HA} particles are able to induce and maintain for a longer time a denser peri-implant bone mantle in osteoporotic bone, which may have important implications in the prevention of implant migration and cut-outs.},

By slightly modifying the B-spline classification for the {WEB}\{basis, the centers of the supports of inner B-splines can be used as collocation points.  This resolves the mismatch between the number of basis functions and
interpolation conditions, already present in classical univariate schemes, in a simple
fashion.
Collocation with {WEB}\{splines is very easy to implement;  sample programs are
available on the website
www.web-spline.de. In contrast to standard finite element methods, no mesh generation and numerical integration is required, regardless of the geometric  shape  of  the  domain. As a  consequence,  computing times  are  considerably shorter than for Ritz-Galerkin schemes.  Moreover, numerical tests confirm that
increasing the B-spline degree yields highly accurate approximations already on rel-

	abstract = {It is known that low bone quality, caused for instance by osteoporosis, not only increases the risk of fractures, but also decreases the performance of fracture implants; yet the specific mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still largely unknown. We hypothesized that especially peri-implant bone microstructure affects implant stability in trabecular bone, to a greater degree than more distant bone. To test this hypothesis we performed a computational study on implant stability in trabecular bone. Twelve humeral heads were measured using micro-computed tomography. Screws were inserted digitally into these heads at 25 positions. In addition, at each screw location, a virtual biopsy was taken. Bone structural quality was quantified by morphometric parameters. The stiffness of the 300 screw-bone constructs was quantified as a measure of implant stability. Global bone density correlated moderately with screw–bone stiffness (r2 = 0.52), whereas local bone density was a very good predictor (r2 = 0.91). The best correlation with screw–bone stiffness was found for local bone apparent Young's modulus (r2 = 0.97), revealing that not only bone mass but also its arrangement in the trabecular microarchitecture are important for implant stability. In conclusion, we confirmed our hypothesis that implant stability is affected by the microstructural bone quality of the trabecular bone in the direct vicinity of the implant. Local bone density was the best single morphometric predictor of implant stability. The best predictability was provided by the mechanical competence of the peri-implant bone. A clinical implication of this work is that apparently good bone stock, such as assessed by {DXA}, does not guarantee good local bone quality, and hence does not guarantee good implant stability. New tools that could quantify the structural or mechanical quality of the peri-implant bone may help improve the surgical intervention in reaching better clinical outcomes for screw fixation.},

The {SMD} process is a novel manufacturing technology, similar to the multi-pass welding used for building features such as lugs and flanges on fabricated components (see Fig. 1a and b). A fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted including phase-change phenomena defined in terms of both latent heat release and shrinkage effects. Temperature evolution as well as residual stresses and distortions, due to the successive welding layers deposited, are accurately simulated coupling the heat transfer and the mechanical analysis. The material behavior is characterized by a thermo-elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model coupled with a metallurgical model. Nickel super-alloy 718 is the target material of this work. Both heat convection and heat radiation models are introduced to dissipate heat through the boundaries of the component. An in-house coupled {FE} software is used to deal with the numerical simulation and an ad-hoc activation methodology is formulated to simulate the deposition of the different layers of filler material. Difficulties and simplifying hypotheses are discussed. Thermo-mechanical results are presented in terms of both temperature evolution and distortions, and compared with the experimental data obtained at the {SMD} laboratory of {ITP}.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an immersed boundary ({IB}) method to simulate a 2 dimensional wet foam. Whereas most of the volume in a dry foam is attributed to its gas phase, a wet foam contains a considerable amount of liquid volume which comprises the Plateau borders as well as thin liquid boundaries separating cells. Wet foam dynamics involves the interaction between a surrounding gas, a liquid inside the Plateau borders, and a collection of thin liquid-film boundaries that partition a domain filled with gas and liquid into discrete cells and Plateau borders. The liquid-film boundaries are flexible, contract under the influence of surface tension. The boundary between cells is permeable to the gas, which moves across them by diffusion at a rate proportional to the local pressure difference across the boundary. The boundary between a cell and a Plateau border is impermeable to the gas, however. We here introduce an {IB} method that takes into account the non-equilibrium fluid mechanics of the fluid. To model gas diffusion across the internal boundaries between cells, we allow normal slip between the boundary and the gas at velocity proportional to the (normal) force generated by the boundary surface tension. We implement this method in the two-dimensional case, and test it by verifying the modified von-Neumann relation, which governs the coarsening of a two-dimensional wet foam. The method is further valiyeard by a convergence study, which confirms its first-order accuracy. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional higher-order {eXtended} finite element method ({XFEM})-computations still pose challenging computational geometry problems especially for moving interfaces. This paper provides a method for the localization of a higher-order interface finite element ({FE}) mesh in an underlying three-dimensional higher-order {FE} mesh. Additionally, it demonstrates, how a subtetrahedralization of an intersected element can be obtained, which preserves the possibly curved interface and allows therefore exact numerical integration. The proposed interface algorithm collects initially a set of possibly intersecting elements by comparing their ‘{eXtended} axis-aligned bounding boxes’. The intersection method is applied to a highly reduced number of intersection candiyears. The resulting linearized interface is used as input for an elementwise constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization, which computes an appropriate subdivision for each intersected element. The curved interface is recovered from the linearized interface in the last step. The output comprises triangular integration cells representing the interface and tetrahedral integration cells for each intersected element. Application of the interface algorithm currently concentrates on fluid–structure interaction problems on low-order and higher-order {FE} meshes, which may be composed of any arbitrary element types such as hexahedra, tetrahedra, wedges, etc. Nevertheless, other {XFEM}-problems with explicitly given interfaces or discontinuities may be tackled in addition. Multiple structures and interfaces per intersected element can be handled without any additional difficulties. Several parallelization strategies exist depending on the desired domain decomposition approach. Numerical test cases including various geometrical exceptions demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the interface handling. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In order to obtain desirable mechanical transformations in a workpiece using a thermal treatment process, the optimal control parameters need to be determined. The problem is addressed by posing the process as a decoupled thermo-mechanical finite element problem and performing an optimization using gradient methods. The forward problem is solved using the Eulerian formulation since it is computationally more efficient compared to an equivalent Lagrangian formulation. The design sensitivities required for the optimization are developed analytically using direct differentiation. This systematic design approach is applied to optimize a laser forming process. The objective is to maximize the angular distortion of a specimen subject to the constraint that the phase transition temperature is not exceeded at any point in the model.

The general methodology is developed for an abstract nonlinear parabolic {PDE} and subsequently applied to linear heat and nonlinear Cahn–Hilliard equations. The error due to finite element approximations is estimated with a residual weighted approximate-dual solution which is computed with two primal approximations at nested levels. We prove that the exact error is estimated by our estimator up to higher-order remainder terms. Numerical experiments confirm the theory regarding consistency of the dual-based two-level estimator.

	abstract = {An elastic finite element method ({FEM}) for predicting welding distortions of large welded structures is developed. In the proposed elastic {FEM}, the inherent deformation is used to model the local deformation induced by welding, and the interface element is introduced to simulate the joining process and the correction of the gap between the welded parts. In this study, our emphasis is focused on examining the influence of initial gap on the final welding distortion. First, the usefulness of the proposed method is verified by experiment with simple welded structures. Secondly, the welding distortion of an asymmetric curved plate structure without initial gap is predicted using this elastic {FEM}. Finally, the influence of the initial gaps on the final welding distortion in the asymmetric curved plate structure is investigated.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to report our quantitative computed tomography ({QCT}) density-mechanical property regressions for trabecular bone for use in biomechanical modelling of the human spine. Cylindrical specimens of human vertebral trabecular bone (from T10 to L4) were cored from 32 cadavers (mean +/- {SD} age = 70.1 +/- 16.8; 13 females, 19 males) and scanned using {QCT}. Mechanical tests were conducted using a protocol that minimized end-artifacts over the apparent density range tested (0.09-0.38 g/cm3). To account for the presence of multiple specimens per donor in this data set, donor was treated as a random effect in the regression model. Mean modulus (319 +/- 189 {MPa}) was higher and mean yield strain (0.78 +/- 0.06\%) was lower than typical values reported previously due to minimization of the end-artifact errors. {QCT} density showed a strong positive correlation with modulus (n = 76) and yield stress (r2 = 0.90-0.95, n = 53, p {\textless} 0.001). There was a weak positive linear correlation with yield strain (r2 = 0.58, n = 53, p = 0.07). Prediction errors, incurred when estimating modulus or strength for specimens from a new donor, were 30-36\% of the mean values of these properties. Direct {QCT} density-mechanical property regressions gave more precise predictions of mechanical properties than if physically measured wet apparent density was used as an intermediate variable to predict mechanical properties from {QCT} density. Use of these {QCT} density-mechanical property regressions should improve the fidelity of {QCT}-based biomechanical models of the human spine for whole bone and bone-implant analyses.},

Its final form contains only primal unknowns; that is, the approach does not introduce additional unknowns at the interface. Additionally, it does not involve problem-dependent parameters, which require an estimation. The presented approach is symmetry preserving; that is, the resulting discrete form of an elliptic equation will remain symmetric and positive definite. It preserves the order of the underlying discretization, and we demonstrate high-order accuracy for problems of non-matching discretizations concerning the mesh size h as well as the polynomial degree of the order of discretization p. We also demonstrate how the method may be used to model material interfaces, which may be curved and for which the interface does not coincide with the underlying mesh. This novel approach is presented in the context of the p-version and B-spline version of the finite cell method, an embedded domain method of high order, and compared with more classical methods such as the penalty method or Nitsche's method.

	abstract = {Small endosseous implants, such as screws, are important components of modern orthopedics and dentistry. Hence they have to reliably fulfill a variety of requirements, which makes the development of such implants challenging. Finite element analysis is a widely used computational tool used to analyze and optimize implant stability in bone. For these purposes, bone is generally modeled as a continuum material. However, bone failure and bone adaptation processes are occurring at the discrete level of individual trabeculae; hence the assessment of stresses and strains at this level is relevant. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate how peri-implant strain distribution and load transfer between implant and bone are affected by the continuum assumption. We performed a computational study in which cancellous screws were inserted in continuum and discrete models of trabecular bone; axial loading was simulated. We found strong differences in bone-implant stiffness between the discrete and continuum bone model. They depended on bone density and applied boundary conditions. Furthermore, load transfer from the screw to the surrounding bone differed strongly between the continuum and discrete models, especially for low-density bone. Based on our findings we conclude that continuum bone models are of limited use for finite element analysis of peri-implant mechanical loading in trabecular bone when a precise quantification of peri-implant stresses and strains is required. Therefore, for the assessment and improvement of trabecular bone implants, finite element models which accurately represent trabecular microarchitecture should be used.},

	abstract = {Secure fixation of fractured osteoporotic bone is a serious clinical challenge mainly because the reduced mechanical competence of low-density bone hampers proper implant fixation. Recent experimental findings have shown strong evidence for a rather complex bone–implant interface contact behavior, with frictional and non-linear mechanical properties. Furthermore, the bone microarchitecture is highly diverse even within the same anatomical site of a specific individual. Due to this intrinsic variability experimental studies that could analyze in detail the contributions of screw designs and thread geometry would require a very large amount of bone specimens; this hampers finding potential improvements for implant fixation. As a complementary approach, computational methods may overcome this limitation, since the same specimen can be tested repeatedly in numerous configurations and under various loading conditions. Recent advances in imaging techniques combined with parallel computing methods have enabled the creation of high-resolution finite-element models that are able to represent bone–implant systems in great detail. Yet, the predictive power of the mechanical competence of bone–implant systems is still limited, both on the apparent level and on the local microstructural level. The current strategy in high-resolution {FE} models to model the bone–implant interface, employing fully bonded cube-like elements, needs to be reconsidered, refined and valiyeard, such that it mimics more closely the actual non-linear mechanical behavior as observed in vitro in order to exploit the full potential of numeric models as an effective, complementary research method to physical in vitro models.},

A fictitious domain method extended with a local mesh adaptation algorithm provides the required flexibility with respect to the motion and deformation of the valve. In addition, it ensures the solids ability of sustaining pressures present in the fluid. Making use of the fact that the fluid and solid mesh are not required to be connected conformingly, it is shown that the model can be extended with a contact algorithm without introducing meshing complications near the contact surfaces.

We propose a partitioned fluid-structure algorithm which keeps the fluid and structure solvers independent and which is able to manage contact without assuming that the structure solvers include contact capabilities. Various numerical tests are proposed. In particular, when the displacement is moderate, we show that the results are in good agreement with Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian ({ALE}) simulations.

These results suggest that bone-implant constructs can be analyzed using μ{FE} in a detailed and unprecedented way.

	abstract = {In this paper, we extend (Kim et al., 2010 [13]) to the three-dimensional dry foam case, i.e., a foam in which most of the volume is attributed to its gas phase. Dry foam dynamics involves the interaction between a gas and a collection of thin liquid-film internal boundaries that partitions the gas into discrete cells or bubbles. The liquid-film boundaries are flexible, contract under the influence of surface tension, and are permeable to the gas which moves across them by diffusion at a rate proportional to the local pressure difference across the boundary. Such problems are conventionally studied by assuming that the pressure is uniform within each bubble. Here, we introduce instead an immersed boundary method that takes into account the non-equilibrium fluid mechanics of the gas. To model gas diffusion across the internal liquid-film boundaries, we allow normal slip between the boundary and the gas at a velocity proportional to the (normal) force generated by the boundary surface tension. We implement this method in the three-dimensional framework, and test it by verifying the 3D generalization of the von Neumann relation, which governs the coarsening of a three-dimensional dry foam.

The objective of this scheme is to minimize the computational cost of integrating the entire element matrix as opposed to minimizing the cost of integrating a single function. The efficiency of the new technique is compared with Gaussian quadrature and found to take a small fraction of the computational effort.},

We focus on such a model for laminate composite plate and shell models in the framework of isogeometric analysis. We apply an exact but dimensionally reduced geometry description based on a computer-aided design ({CAD}) derived mid-surface {NURBS} model and a layerwise through-thickness B-spline description. Using the unique and characteristic refinement capabilities of isogeometric analysis we simplify the modeling process while keeping the higher order and higher continuity properties of {NURBS}. Trimmed geometries, as common in {CAD} models are efficiently handled by an embedded domain method which treats trimmed areas as a fictitious extension domain in the computational model. We verify our approach with several examples for moderately thick laminate plate and shell models and compare our results to existing 3D solutions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an immersed boundary ({IB}) method to simulate a dry foam, i.e., a foam in which most of the volume is attributed to its gas phase. Dry foam dynamics involves the interaction between a gas and a collection of thin liquid-film internal boundaries that partition the gas into discrete cells or bubbles. The liquid-film boundaries are flexible, contract under the influence of surface tension, and are permeable to the gas, which moves across them by diffusion at a rate proportional to the local pressure difference across the boundary. Such problems are conventionally studied by assuming that the pressure is uniform within each bubble. Here, we introduce instead an {IB} method that takes into account the non-equilibrium fluid mechanics of the gas. To model gas diffusion across the internal liquid-film boundaries, we allow normal slip between the boundary and the gas at a velocity proportional to the (normal) force generated by the boundary surface tension. We implement this method in the two-dimensional case, and test it by verifying the von Neumann relation, which governs the coarsening of a two-dimensional dry foam. The method is further valiyeard by a convergence study, which confirms its first-order accuracy. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

With regard to peri-implant bone, cortical and trabecular compartments both contribute to the load transfer from the implant to the surrounding bone but their relative roles have yet to be investigated in detail. However, this knowledge is crucial for the better understanding of implant failure and for the development of new implants. This is especially true for osteoporotic bone, which is characterized by a deterioration of the trabecular architecture and a thinning of the cortical shell, leading to a higher probability of implant loosening. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative biomechanical roles of cortical and trabecular bone on implant pull-out stiffness in human vertebrae. The starting point of our investigation was a micro-computed tomography scan of an adult human vertebra. The cortical shell was identified and an implant was digitally inserted into the vertebral body. Pull-out tests were simulated with micro-finite element analysis and the apparent stiffness of the system with various degrees of shell thickness and bone volume fraction was computed. Our computational models demonstrated that cortical bone, although being very thin, plays a major role in the mechanical competence of the bone–implant construct.},

Welding distortion often results in problems such as dimensional inaccuracies during the assembly and increased fabrication costs. Therefore, prediction and reduction of welding distortion are critical to improve the quality of welded structures. Welding distortion during the assembly process is affected by not only local shrinkage due to rapid heating and cooling, but also root gap and misalignment between parts to be welded. In this study, based on inherent strain theory, an elastic finite element method is developed to precisely predict welding distortion during the assembly process considering both local shrinkage and root gap. First, thermal elastic–plastic finite element method is employed to estimate inherent deformations for different typical welding joints. Second, the proposed elastic {FEM} is used to predict welding distortion for large welded structures based on the obtained inherent deformations. Meanwhile, the influence of initial gap on welding distortion is investigated. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify the simulated results. The effectiveness of the proposed elastic {FEM} is confirmed using experimental results.},

	abstract = {The mechanical behavior of trabecular bone depends on the internal bone structure. It is generally accepted now that the trabecular bone structure is a result of a load adaptive bone remodeling. The mathematical laws that relate bone remodeling to the local state of stress and strain, however, are still under investigation. The aim of this project was to investigate if changes in the trabecular architecture as observed with age-related bone loss and osteoporosis can be predicted from a computer model that simulates bone resorption after hormone depletion based on realistic models of trabecular microstructure using micro-computed tomography ({muCT}). A compact desktop {muCT} providing a nominal isotropic resolution of 14 mum was used to measure two groups of seven trabecular bone specimens from pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women respectively. A novel algorithm was developed to simulate age-related bone loss for the specimens in the first group. The algorithm, also referred to as simulated bone atrophy ({SIBA}), describes a truly three-dimensional approach and is based directly on cellular bone remodeling with an underlying realistic time frame. Bone resorption is controlled by osteoclastic penetration depth and bone formation is governed by the efficiency level of the osteoblasts. The simulation itself describes an iterative process with a cellular remodeling cycle of 197 days. Activation frequency is controllable and can be adjusted for the different phases of pre-, peri- and post-menopause. For our simulations, osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities were in balance until the onset of menopause, set to be at the age of 50 years. In that period, the structure remained almost constant. After the onset of menopause an imbalance in the cell activities was modeled resulting in a net bone loss. The doubling of the activation frequency in the peri-menopausal phase caused a pronounced loss. Using advanced animation tools and quantitative bone morphometry, the changes in bone architecture associated with the bone loss were monitored over an average observation time of 43 years until the age of 80 years. In that time, bone volume density decreased monotonously with the progression of the simulation for all specimens. Right after the onset of menopause, bone was lost fast, where with the progression of age losses slowed down. The structures at the end-point of the simulations were then compared qualitatively and quantitatively to the structures of the post-menopausal group with all morphometric indices being within a narrow margin of error. These results suggest the feasibility of transforming "normal" to "osteopenic" bone on a microstructural level yielding in realistic bone models similar in appearance as well as in structural behavior if compared to a post-menopausal group of women.},

The study uses the example of butt welding thin rectangular plates, the results of main interest being the out-of plane distortion and longitudinal residual stresses. The {FE} model results are compared to experimental data and simplified analytical algorithms that have been developed and valiyeard in the context of a project to improve the prediction and control of welding distortion in thin welded structures.},

All necessary operations for the description of the contact problems: kinematics, all differential operations etc. are defined in the covariant form in the local coordinate system which corresponds to the closest point procedure. The main advantage is a geometrical structure of the full tangent matrix, which is is subdivided into main, rotational and curvature parts. The consistent linearization of the penalty regularized contact integral leads to a symmetrical tangent matrix in the case of sticking. Representative examples show the effectiveness of the approach for problems where the definition of sticking-sliding zones is necessary as well as for the case of fully developed sliding zones.},

The interface between the coating and the substrate is commonly described by cohesive zones, for which several different cohesive zone laws have been proposed in literature. Among the widening class of developed cohesive zone laws this paper focuses on the most frequently adopted law of Xu and Needleman. It is shown that this cohesive zone law needs improvement in order to describe a mixed-mode decohesion process. This conclusion is based on investigations of the influence of the coupling parameters and the assessment of the work-of-separation under mixed-mode conditions. Remedies for this problem with the Xu and Needleman law are not yet available in literature. An alternative exponential cohesive zone law, derived from the law of Xu and Needleman, is presented, which correctly describes mixed-mode decohesion.

We give several examples of how sudden “solution jumps” can occur in rate-independent models like the Tvergaard depending on the geometry, interface behavior, and finite element discretization. This kind of instability disappears for the often-used viscous models, but the result is a high rate dependency that deviate from experimental trends.

A new kind of viscous regularization is proposed here, which applies to the Tvergaard debonding model or modified ones, and has a limited rate dependency. A few simple examples are given, including the delamination of a double cantilever beam, to show the capabilities of the technique proposed.},

The typical limit points in this oscillatory path can be traced by application of path-following techniques, or avoided altogether by adequately refining the mesh until the standard iterative Newton–Raphson method becomes applicable. Both strategies however lead to an unacceptably high computational cost and a low efficiency, justifying the development of a process driven hierarchical extension of the discretization used in the process zone of a cohesive crack. A self-adaptive enrichment scheme within individual cohesive zone elements driven by the physics governing the problem, is an efficient solution that does not require further mesh refinements. A two-dimensional mixed-mode example in a general framework with an irreversible cohesive zone law shows that an enriched formulation restores the smoothness of the solution in structures that are discretized in a relatively coarse manner.},

	abstract = {Dynamic crack growth is analysed numerically for a plane strain block with an initial central crack subject to tensile loading. The continuum is characterized by a material constitutive law that relates stress and strain, and by a relation between the tractions and displacement jumps across a specified set of cohesive surfaces. The material constitutive relation is that of an isotropic hyperelastic solid. The cohesive surface constitutive relation allows for the creation of new free surface and dimensional considerations introduce a characteristic length into the formulation. Full transient analyses are carried out. Crack branching emerges as a natural outcome of the initial-boundary value problem solution, without any ad hoc assumption regarding branching criteria. Coarse mesh calculations are used to explore various qualitative features such as the effect of impact velocity on crack branching, and the effect of an inhomogeneity in strength, as in crack growth along or up to an interface. The effect of cohesive surface orientation on crack path is also explored, and for a range of orientations zigzag crack growth precedes crack branching. Finer mesh calculations are carried out where crack growth is confined to the initial crack plane. The crack accelerates and then grows at a constant speed that, for high impact velocities, can exceed the Rayleigh wave speed. This is due to the finite strength of the cohesive surfaces. A fine mesh calculation is also carried out where the path of crack growth is not constrained. The crack speed reaches about 45\% of the Rayleigh wave speed, then the crack speed begins to oscillate and crack branching at an angle of about 29° from the initial crack plane occurs. The numerical results are at least qualitatively in accord with a wide variety of experimental observations on fast crack growth in brittle solids.},

Using finite element shape functions as partitions of unity, the displacement jump across a crack is represented by extra degrees of freedom at existing nodes.

The particles are taken to be rigid and the elastic-plastic deformations of the matrix are described in terms of continuum crystalline plasticity, using a planar crystal model that allows for three slip systems. Comparison is made with void-nucleation predictions based on a corresponding flow theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening. The crystal model can give rise to shear localization at the particle-matrix interface and shear localization, which leads to large localized strains in the matrix, is found to inhibit decohesion. The role of the triaxiality of the stress state in determining whether decohesion or localization occurs first is investigated. A parameteric study is also carried out for a crystal matrix using two descriptions of the interface shear behaviour; one is periodic in the shear displacement across the interface, while the other allows for shear decohesion.},

However, the numerical concerns and limitations stemming from the application of interface cohesive zone models in a quasi-static finite element framework increase considerably as the relative size of the process zone decreases. An excessively fine mesh is required in the process zone to accurately resolve the distribution of tractions in a relatively small moving zone. With a moderate mesh size, inefficient path-following techniques have to be employed to trace the local discretization-induced snap-backs. In order to increase the applicability of cohesive zone models by reducing their numerical deficiencies, a self-adaptive finite element framework is proposed, based on a hierarchical enrichment of the standard elements. With this approach, the planar mixed-mode crack growth in a general three-dimensional continuum, discretized by a coarse mesh, can be modeled while the set of equations of the non-linear system is solved by a standard Newton–Raphson iterative procedure. This hierarchical scheme was found to be most effective in reducing the oscillatory behavior of the global response.},

In these models, non-linear relationships between tractions and relative displacements are assumed, which dictate both the work of separation per unit fracture surface and the peak stress that has to be reached for the crack formation. This contribution deals with isogeometric {CZ} modeling of interface debonding. The interface is discretized with generalized contact elements which account for both contact and cohesive debonding within a unified framework. The formulation is suitable for non-matching discretizations of the interacting surfaces in presence of large deformations and large relative displacements. The isogeometric discretizations are based on non uniform rational B-splines as well as analysis-suitable T-splines enabling local refinement. Conventional Lagrange polynomial discretizations are also used for comparison purposes. Some numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed formulation based on isogeometric analysis is a computationally accurate and efficient technology to solve challenging interface debonding problems in 2D and 3D.},

	abstract = {The phenomena of crack initiation, propagation and ultimate fracture are studied here under the following assumptions: (i) the crack law is modelled by means of a cohesive zone model and (ii) the crack paths are postulated a priori. In this context, a variational formulation is proposed which relies on an augmented Lagrangian. A mixed interface finite element is introduced to discretise the crack paths, the degrees of freedom of which consist in the displacement on both crack lips and the density of cohesive forces. This enables an exact treatment of multi-valued cohesive laws (e.g. initial adhesion, contact conditions, possible rigid unloading, etc.), without penalty regularisation.

A special attention is paid to the convergence with mesh-refinement, i.e. the well-posedness of the problem, on the basis of theoretical results of contact mechanics and some complementary numerical investigations. Fulfilment of the {LBB} condition is the key factor to gain the desired properties. Moreover, it is shown that the integration of the constitutive law admits a unique solution as soon as some condition on the augmented Lagrangian is enforced. Finally, a 3D simulation shows the applicability to practical engineer problems, including in particular the robustness of the formulation and its compatibility with classical solution algorithms (Newton method, line-search, path-following techniques).},

	abstract = {The modeling of progressive delamination by means of a discrete damage zone model within the extended finite element method is investigated. This framework allows for both bulk and interface damages to be conveniently traced, regardless of the underlying mesh alignment. For discrete interfaces, a new mixed-mode force–separation relation, which accounts for the coupled interaction between opening and sliding modes, is proposed. The model is based on the concept of Continuum Damage Mechanics and is shown to be thermodynamically consistent. An integral-type nonlocal damage is adopted in the bulk to regularize the softening material response. The resulting nonlinear equations are solved using a Newton scheme with a dissipation-based arc-length constraint, for which an analytical Jacobian is derived. Several benchmark delamination studies, as well as failure analyses of a fiber/epoxy unit cell, are presented and discussed in detail. The proposed model is valiyeard against available analytical/experimental data and is found to be robust and mesh insensitive.},

	abstract = {Phase-field models based on the variational formulation for brittle fracture have recently been shown capable of accurately and robustly predicting complex crack behavior. Their numerical implementation requires costly operations at the quadrature point level, which may include finding eigenvalues and forming tensor projection operators. We explore the application of isogeometric collocation methods for the discretization of second-order and fourth-order phase-field fracture models. We show that a switch from isogeometric Galerkin to isogeometric collocation methods has the potential to significantly speed up phase-field fracture computations due to a reduction of point evaluations. We advocate a hybrid collocation–Galerkin formulation that provides a consistent way of weakly enforcing Neumann boundary conditions and multi-patch interface constraints, is able to handle the multiple boundary integral terms that arise from the weighted residual formulation, and offers the flexibility to adaptively improve the crack resolution in the fracture zone. We present numerical examples in one and two dimensions that illustrate the advantages of our approach.},

Hence, they effectively link meshes of different resolution along their nonmatching interface. Particularly, they provide a powerful tool, when combined with homogenization schemes, for multiscale computing for complex heterogeneous structures.

Several two and three dimensional examples ranging from standard delamination tests (the mixed mode bending test) to the L-shaped specimen with a fillet, three dimensional (3D) double cantilever beam and a 3D singly curved thick-walled laminate are provided.

The method is one of the novel computational methods and is highly developed within the last decade. One of the major problems of {FCM} is the description of boundary conditions inside cells as well as in sub-cells. And a completely open problem is the description of contact. Therefore, the motivation of the current work is to develop a set of computational contact mechanics approaches which will be effective for the finite element cell method. Thus, for the {FCM} method we are developing and testing hereby focusing on the Hertz problem the following algorithms: direct integration in the cell method, allowing the fastest implementation, but suffering from numerical artifacts such as the “stamp effect”; the most efficient scheme concerning approximation properties the cell-surface-to-analytical-surface contact element designed for contact with rigid bodies leading to cell-wisely contact elements; and finally the discrete-cell-to-cell contact approach based on the finite discrete method. All developed methods are carefully verified with the analytical Hertz solution. The cell subdivisions, the order of the shape functions as well as the selection of the classes for shape functions are investigated for all developed contact approaches. This analysis allows to choose the most robust approach depending on the needs of the user such as correct representation of the stresses, or only satisfaction of geometrical non-penetration conditions.},

neering materials is emphasised and ways to incorporate the cohesive–zone methodology in
computational methods are discussed. Numerical implementations of cohesive–zone mod-
els suffer from a certain mesh bias. For discrete representations this is caused by the initial
mesh design, while for smeared representations it is rooted in the ill–posedness of the rate
boundary value problem that arises upon the introduction of decohesion. A proper represen-
tation of the discrete character of cohesive–zone formulations which avoids any mesh bias
can be obtained elegantly when exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element
shape functions. A recent development, so-called cohesive crack segments, which are par-
ticularly suited to simulate the entire process of crack nucleation, growth and coalescence is
presented. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by some examples for crack
nucleation and growth in heterogeneous materials and for fast crack growth.},

	abstract = {The importance of the cohesive-zone approach to analyse localisation and fracture in engineering materials is emphasised and ways to incorporate the cohesive-zone methodology in computational methods are discussed. Until recently, numerical implementations of cohesive-zone models have suffered from a certain mesh bias. For discrete representations this is caused by the initial mesh design, while for smeared representations it is rooted in the ill-posedness of the rate boundary value problem that arises upon the introduction of decohesion. A proper representation of the discrete character of cohesive-zone formulations which avoids any mesh bias is obtained by exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element shape functions. The recently developed cohesive segments method, which is well-suited for simulating the entire process of crack nucleation, growth and coalescence is reviewed. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by some examples for crack nucleation and growth in heterogeneous materials and for fast crack growth.},

	abstract = {Delamination in composite structures is best modelled at a mesoscopic level. In this approach, the plies are modelled as continua, which can either be assumed to behave linearly elastically or to degrade according to a damage law. Delamination in the interfaces between them is modelled using a discrete relation between interface tractions and relative displacements. Key in this type of modelling is the presence of a work of separation or fracture energy, which governs the growth of the delamination. This cohesive-surface approach has traditionally been implemented numerically using special interface elements which connect the continuum elements that are used to model the plies. Exploiting the partition-of-unity property of finite element shape functions to model the interface separation process offers some advantages, since interfaces can be inserted at the onset of delamination and not a priori, as in the conventional approach. As a consequence, elastic compliance of the interface prior to onset of delamination, spurious traction oscillations ahead of the delamination front and spurious wave reflections because of the presence of a high stiffness value are avoided. Moreover, unlike the conventional approach, unstructured meshes can be employed.},

	shorttitle = {The cohesive band model},
	abstract = {In the cohesive surface model cohesive tractions are transmitted across a two-dimensional surface, which is embedded in a three-dimensional continuum. The relevant kinematic quantities are the local crack opening displacement and the crack sliding displacement, but there is no kinematic quantity that represents the stretching of the fracture plane. As a consequence, in-plane stresses are absent, and fracture phenomena as splitting cracks in concrete and masonry, or crazing in polymers, which are governed by stress triaxiality, cannot be represented properly. In this paper we extend the cohesive surface model to include in-plane kinematic quantities. Since the full strain tensor is now available, a three-dimensional stress state can be computed in a straightforward manner. The cohesive band model is regarded as a subgrid scale fracture model, which has a small, yet finite thickness at the subgrid scale, but can be considered as having a zero thickness in the discretisation method that is used at the macroscopic scale. The standard cohesive surface formulation is obtained when the cohesive band width goes to zero. In principle, any discretisation method that can capture a discontinuity can be used, but partition-of-unity based finite element methods and isogeometric finite element analysis seem to have an advantage since they can naturally incorporate the continuum mechanics. When using interface finite elements, traction oscillations that can occur prior to the opening of a cohesive crack, persist for the cohesive band model. Example calculations show that Poisson contraction influences the results, since there is a coupling between the crack opening and the in-plane normal strain in the cohesive band. This coupling holds promise for capturing a variety of fracture phenomena, such as delamination buckling and splitting cracks, that are difficult, if not impossible, to describe within a conventional cohesive surface model.},

Generalized plane strain elements and interface elements have been developed for this purpose. Thermal and hygroscopic effects have been taken into account for the modelling of the plys, and a mode-I fracture model which incorporates strain softening has been used for the interface behaviour. The out-of-plane loading is controlled via an indirect displacement control technique, which permits tracing the entire loading history. Using non-linear finite element analysis free edge delamination in different graphite/epoxy laminates is examined. The numerical results are in good agreement with experimental evidence and do not suffer from spurious mesh dependence. Also the effects of laminate thickness (size effect) can be described properly.},

	abstract = {Vertebral compression fracture is a common medical problem in osteoporotic individuals. The quantitative computed tomography ({QCT})-based finite element ({FE}) method may be used to predict vertebral strength in vivo, but needs to be valiyeard with experimental tests. The aim of this study was to valiyear a nonlinear anatomy specific {QCT}-based {FE} model by using a novel testing setup. Thirty-seven human thoracolumbar vertebral bone slices were prepared by removing cortical endplates and posterior elements. The slices were scanned with {QCT} and the volumetric bone mineral density ({vBMD}) was computed with the standard clinical approach. A novel experimental setup was designed to induce a realistic failure in the vertebral slices in vitro. Rotation of the loading plate was allowed by means of a ball joint. To minimize device compliance, the specimen deformation was measured directly on the loading plate with three sensors. A nonlinear {FE} model was generated from the calibrated {QCT} images and computed vertebral stiffness and strength were compared to those measured during the experiments. In agreement with clinical observations, most of the vertebrae underwent an anterior wedge-shape fracture. As expected, the {FE} method predicted both stiffness and strength better than {vBMD} (R2 improved from 0.27 to 0.49 and from 0.34 to 0.79, respectively). Despite the lack of fitting parameters, the linear regression of the {FE} prediction for strength was close to the 1:1 relation (slope and intercept close to one (0.86 {kN}) and to zero (0.72 {kN}), respectively). In conclusion, a nonlinear {FE} model was successfully valiyeard through a novel experimental technique for generating wedge-shape fractures in human thoracolumbar vertebrae.},

In computational contact analysis, the mortar approach allows for a variationally consistent treatment of non-penetration and frictional sliding constraints despite the inevitably non-matching interface meshes. Other single-field and multi-field problems, such as fluid–structure interaction ({FSI}), also benefit from the increased modeling flexibility provided by mortar methods. This contribution gives a review of the most important aspects of mortar finite element discretization and dual Lagrange multiplier interpolation for the aforementioned applications. The focus is on parallel efficiency, which is addressed by a new dynamic load balancing strategy and tailored parallel search algorithms for computational contact mechanics. For validation purposes, simulation examples from solid dynamics, contact dynamics and {FSI} will be discussed.},

	abstract = {The paper is concerned with a new numerical method, {NURBS} based hybrid collocation–Galerkin method ({NURBS}-{HCGM}), to solve the in-plane motion problem of elastic solids. It combines the merits of the so-called scaled boundary finite-element method ({SB}-{FEM}) and the isogeometric collocation method. For the analysis, the boundary scaling technique of {SB}-{FEM} is adopted. It leads to a formulation, where only the boundary of a structure is discretized. Here, the {NURBS} basis functions are employed for the description of the geometry of the boundary as well as for the approximation of the displacements at the boundary. This is in accordance with the boundary representation modeling technique, which is commonly employed in computer aided design software. The inner domain is described by a radial scaling parameter. Applying the weak form only in circumferential direction the governing partial differential equations of elasticity are transformed to an ordinary differential equation ({ODE}) of Euler type, where the unknown displacements are a function of the radial scaling parameter. In the present work a {NURBS} based collocation scheme is introduced to solve this equation. {NURBS} basis functions are suggested for the approximation of the displacements in scaling direction. The higher continuity provided by {NURBS} allows to use collocation to solve the {ODE} directly instead of using the weak form in scaling direction. The proposed approach is valiyeard by comparison with the eigenvalue solution of the {ODE}. It is remarked that the eigenvalue solution is restricted to linear problems, whereas the proposed method could be extended to nonlinear problems. In general, the presented formulation will allow to model patches bounded by an arbitrary number of contour boundaries. The accuracy of the proposed approach is analyzed and estimated with respect to analytical solutions. The computational cost is investigated with the help of numerical examples and is compared to isogeometric Galerkin approach.},

In addition, the material Young's modulus (i.e. of the trabeculae themselves) was estimated using an ultrasonic technique. Apparent and true density were determined by direct physical measurements. Significant mechanical anisotropy was observed: mean structural Young's modulus varied from 165 {MPa} in the supero-inferior direction to 43 {MPa} in the lateral direction. Structural Young's modulus correlated with apparent density, with power-law regression models giving the best correlations (r2=0.52–0.88). Mechanical anisotropy increased as a function of decreasing apparent density (p\&lt;0.001). Material Young's modulus was 10.0±1.3 {GPa}, and was negatively correlated with apparent density (p\&lt;0.001). In multiple regression models, material Young's modulus was a significant independent predictor of structural Young's modulus only in the supero-inferior direction. The data suggest the presence of two effects in vertebral bone associated with decreasing apparent density and, by implication, bone loss in general: (a) increased mechanical anisotropy, such that there is relative conservation of stiffness in the axial direction compared with the transverse directions; and (b) increased stiffness of the trabeculae themselves.},

	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase-field. In this paper, we outline a thermodynamically consistent framework for phase-field models of crack propagation in elastic solids, develop incremental variational principles and consider their numerical implementations by multi-field finite element methods. We start our investigation with an intuitive and descriptive derivation of a regularized crack surface functional that Γ-converges for vanishing length-scale parameter to a sharp crack topology functional. This functional provides the basis for the definition of suitable convex dissipation functions that govern the evolution of the crack phase-field. Here, we propose alternative rate-independent and viscous over-force models that ensure the local growth of the phase-field. Next, we define an energy storage function whose positive tensile part degrades with increasing phase-field. With these constitutive functionals at hand, we derive the coupled balances of quasi-static stress equilibrium and gradient-type phase-field evolution in the solid from the argument of virtual power. Here, we consider a canonical two-field setting for rate-independent response and a time-regularized three-field formulation with viscous over-force response. It is then shown that these balances follow as the Euler equations of incremental variational principles that govern the multi-field problems. These principles make the proposed formulation extremely compact and provide a perfect base for the finite element implementation, including features such as the symmetry of the monolithic tangent matrices. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed phase-field formulations of fracture by means of representative numerical examples. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering {DOI}:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively upyears in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

Existing techniques typically rely on the underlying bulk mesh to implicitly partition the surface, a strategy that can give rise to overconstraint. In the present work, we first apply a mortaring algorithm to the modeling of frictional contact conditions on arbitrary interfaces. The algorithm is based upon a projection of the bulk and surface fields onto independent mortar fields at the interface. We examine the advantages of this approach when combined with extended finite-element approximations to the bulk fields. In particular, the method allows for bulk and surface domains to be partitioned separately, as well as enforce nonlinear contact constraints on surfaces that are not explicitly “fitted” to the bulk mesh. Results from several benchmark problems in frictional contact are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the method, as well as the improvement in robustness compared to existing techniques. We also provide an example that illustrates the effectiveness of the approach in high-speed machining simulation.},

	abstract = {We present a fixed-grid finite element technique for fluid–structure interaction problems involving incompressible viscous flows and thin structures. The flow equations are discretised with isoparametric b-spline basis functions defined on a logically Cartesian grid. In addition, the previously proposed subdivision-stabilisation technique is used to ensure inf–sup stability. The beam equations are discretised with b-splines and the shell equations with subdivision basis functions, both leading to a rotation-free formulation. The interface conditions between the fluid and the structure are enforced with the Nitsche technique. The resulting coupled system of equations is solved with a Dirichlet–Robin partitioning scheme, and the fluid equations are solved with a pressure–correction method. Auxiliary techniques employed for improving numerical robustness include the level-set based implicit representation of the structure interface on the fluid grid, a cut-cell integration algorithm based on marching tetrahedra and the conservative data transfer between the fluid and structure discretisations. A number of verification and validation examples, primarily motivated by animal locomotion in air or water, demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.

The classical ply-by-ply discretization of individual layers may increase the size of the problem by an order of magnitude in comparison with the laminated shell or plate element meshes. The paper features delamination indicators that pinpoint the onset and propagation of delamination fronts with striking accuracy. Once the location of delamination has been identified, the discrete solution space of the classical laminated plate/shell element is hierarchically enriched by a combination of weak and strong discontinuities to adaptively track the evolution of delamination fronts. The so-called adaptive s-method proposed herein is equivalent in terms of approximation space to the extended finite element method but offers sparser matrices and added flexibility in transitioning from weak to strong discontinuities. Numerical examples suggest that despite an overhead that comes with adaptivity, the adaptive s-method is computationally advantageous over the classical ply-by-ply discretization, especially as the problem size increases.

In the context of a cohesive approach to fracture, properly resolving the cohesive zone ensures that the resistance is in equilibrium with the driving force. Additional restrictions on the mesh size can stem from crack stability. For high strength, low toughness (brittle) materials, the requirements for stability can exceed those for cohesive zone resolution. Examples in 1-D and 2-D reveal that decrements in the mesh size transition the system from indefinite to positive definite. Moreover, small decreases in the mesh size beyond the transition provide substantial reductions in the condition number. We contrast a physical instability resulting from material properties, geometry, or boundary conditions from a numerical instability resulting from the mesh size and propose that the selected discretization should ensure that the cohesive zone is both resolved and stabilized.},

	abstract = {The cohesive finite element method ({CFEM}) allows explicit modelling of fracture processes. One form of {CFEM} models integrates cohesive surfaces along all finite element boundaries, facilitating the explicit resolution of arbitrary fracture paths and fracture patterns. This framework also permits explicit account of arbitrary microstructures with multiple length scales, allowing the effects of material heterogeneity, phase morphology, phase size and phase distribution to be quantified. However, use of this form of {CFEM} with cohesive traction–separation laws with finite initial stiffness imposes two competing requirements on the finite element size. On one hand, an upper bound is needed to ensure that fields within crack-tip cohesive zones are accurately described. On the other hand, a lower bound is also required to ensure that the discrete model closely approximates the physical problem at hand. Both issues are analysed in this paper within the context of fracture in multi-phase composite microstructures and a variable stiffness bilinear cohesive model. The resulting criterion for solution convergence is given for meshes with uniform, cross-triangle elements. A series of calculations is carried out to illustrate the issues discussed and to verify the criterion given. These simulations concern dynamic crack growth in an Al2O3 ceramic and in an Al2O3/{TiB}2 ceramic composite whose phases are modelled as being hyperelastic in constitutive behaviour.

The method is constructed by using a discontinuous piecewise linear finite element space defined on a background mesh in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$. The surface is approximated by a continuous piecewise linear surface that cuts through the background mesh in an arbitrary fashion. Then a discontinuous Galerkin method is formulated on the discrete surface and in order to obtain coercivity, certain stabilization terms are added on the faces between neighboring elements that provide control of the discontinuity as well as the jump in the gradient. We derive optimal a priori error and condition number estimates which are independent of the positioning of the surface in the background mesh. Finally, we present numerical examples confirming our theoretical results.},

Modelling affirms that reinforcement with defined microscale structures is applicable to numerous hydrogels. The stiffness and elasticity of the composites approach that of articular cartilage tissue. Human chondrocytes embedded in the composites are viable, retain their round morphology and are responsive to an in vitro physiological loading regime in terms of gene expression and matrix production.

In this paper, we show that such numerical difficulties can easily be avoided by introducing a small viscosity in the constitutive equations for the cohesive interface. Simple boundary value problems are used to develop guidelines for selecting appropriate values of viscosity in numerical simulations involving crack nucleation and growth. As a representative application, we model crack nucleation at the interface between an elastic thin film and an elastic–plastic substrate, which is subjected to contact loading.},

Furthermore, the cohesive zone model is able to adequately predict the behaviour of uncracked structures, including those with blunt notches, and not only the response of bodies with cracks––a usual drawback of most fracture models. The cohesive zone model, originally applied to concrete and cementitious composites, can be used with success for other materials. More powerful computer programs and better knowledge of material properties may widen its potential field of application. In this paper, the cohesive zone model is shown to provide good predictions for concrete and for different notched samples of a glassy polymer ({PMMA}) and some steels. The paper is structured in two main sections: First, the cohesive model is reviewed and emphasis is on determination of the softening function, an essential ingredient of the cohesive model, by inverse analysis procedures. The second section is devoted to some examples of the predictive capability of the cohesive zone model when applied to different materials; concrete, {PMMA} and steel.},

	abstract = {A trend in the last decade towards models in which nonlinear crack tip processes are represented explicitly, rather than being assigned to a point process at the crack tip (as in linear elastic fracture mechanics), is reviewed by a survey of the literature. A good compromise between computational efficiency and physical reality seems to be the cohesive zone formulation, which collapses the effect of the nonlinear crack process zone onto a surface of displacement discontinuity (generalized crack). Damage mechanisms that can be represented by cohesive models include delamination of plies, large splitting (shear) cracks within plies, multiple matrix cracking within plies, fiber rupture or microbuckling (kink band formation), friction acting between delaminated plies, process zones at crack tips representing crazing or other nonlinearity, and large scale bridging by through-thickness reinforcement or oblique crack-bridging fibers. The power of the technique is illustrated here for delamination and splitting cracks in laminates. A cohesive element is presented for simulating three-dimensional, mode-dependent process zones. An essential feature of the formulation is that the delamination crack shape can follow its natural evolution, according to the evolving mode conditions calculated within the simulation. But in numerical work, care must be taken that element sizes are defined consistently with the characteristic lengths of cohesive zones that are implied by the chosen cohesive laws. Qualitatively successful applications are reported to some practical problems in composite engineering, which cannot be adequately analyzed by conventional tools such as linear elastic fracture mechanics and the virtual crack closure technique. The simulations successfully reproduce experimentally measured crack shapes that have been reported in the literature over a decade ago, but have not been reproduced by prior models.},

	abstract = {Adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening schemes are proposed for efficient computational simulation of dynamic cohesive fracture. The adaptive mesh refinement consists of a sequence of edge-split operators, whereas the adaptive mesh coarsening is based on a sequence of vertex-removal (or edge-collapse) operators. Nodal perturbation and edge-swap operators are also employed around the crack tip region to improve crack geometry representation, and cohesive surface elements are adaptively inserted whenever and wherever they are needed by means of an extrinsic cohesive zone model approach. Such adaptive mesh modification events are maintained in conjunction with a topological data structure ({TopS}). The so-called {PPR} potential-based cohesive model (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 2009; 57:891–908) is utilized for the constitutive relationship of the cohesive zone model. The examples investigated include mode I fracture, mixed-mode fracture and crack branching problems. The computational results using mesh adaptivity (refinement and coarsening) are consistent with the results using uniform mesh refinement. The present approach significantly reduces computational cost while exhibiting a multiscale effect that captures both global macro-crack and local micro-cracks.

A standard displacement-based approximation is enriched near a crack by incorporating both discontinuous fields and the near tip asymptotic fields through a partition of unity method. A methodology that constructs the enriched approximation from the interaction of the crack geometry with the mesh is developed. This technique allows the entire crack to be represented independently of the mesh, and so remeshing is not necessary to model crack growth. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed technique. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Analytical solutions for beam specimens used in fracture-mechanics testing of composites and adhesively-bonded joints typically use a beam on an elastic foundation model which assumes that a non-infinite, linear-elastic stiffness exists for the beam on the elastic foundation in the region ahead of the crack tip. Such an approach therefore assumes an elastic-stiffness model but without the need to assume a critical, limiting value of the stress,σ max, for the crack tip region. Hence, they yield asingle fracture parameter, namely the fracture energy,G c. However, the corresponding value ofσ max that results can, of course, be calculated from knowledge of the value {ofG} c. On the other hand, fracture models and criteria have been developed which are based on the approach thattwo parameters exist to describe the fracture process: {namelyG} candσ max. Hereσ max is assumed to be a critical,limiting maximum value of the stress in the damage zone ahead of the crack and is often assumed to have some physical significance. A general representation of the two-parameter failure criteria approach is that of the cohesive zone model ({CZM}). In the present paper, the two-parameter {CZM} approach has been coupled mainly with finite-element analysis ({FEA}) methods. The main aims of the present work are to explore whether the value ofσ max has a unique value for a given problem and whether any physical significance can be ascribed to this parameter. In some instances, both {FEA} and analytical methods are used to provide a useful crosscheck of the two different approaches and the two different analysis methods.},

The resulting discrete method may be severely ill-conditioned, and the main purpose of this paper is to suggest a remedy for this problem based on adding a consistent stabilization term to the original bilinear form. We show optimal estimates for the condition number of the stabilized method independent of the location of the surface. We also prove optimal a priori error estimates for the stabilized method.},

	abstract = {When a material is so soft that the cohesive strength (or adhesive strength, in the case of interfacial fracture) exceeds the elastic modulus of the material, we show that a crack will blunt instead of propagating. Large–deformation finite–element model ({FEM}) simulations of crack initiation, in which the debonding processes are quantified using a cohesive zone model, are used to support this hypothesis. An approximate analytic solution, which agrees well with the {FEM} simulation, gives additional insight into the blunting process. The consequence of this result on the strength of soft, rubbery materials is the main topic of this paper. We propose two mechanisms by which crack growth can occur in such blunted regions. We have also performed experiments on two different elastomers to demonstrate elastic blunting. In one system, we present some details on a void growth mechanism for ultimate failure, post–blunting. Finally, we demonstrate how crack blunting can shed light on some long–standing problems in the area of adhesion and fracture of elastomers.},

	abstract = {The finite element analysis of delamination in laminated composites is addressed using interface elements and an interface damage law. The principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics are indirectly used by equating, in the case of single-mode delamination, the area underneath the traction/relative displacement curve to the critical energy release rate of the mode under examination. For mixed-mode delamination an interaction model is used which can fulfil various fracture criteria proposed in the literature. It is then shown that the model can be recast in the framework of a more general damage mechanics theory. Numerical results are presented for the analyses of a double cantilever beam specimen and for a problem involving multiple delamination for which comparisons are made with experimental results. Issues related with the numerical solution of the non-linear problem of the delamination are discussed, such as the influence of the interface strength on the convergence properties and the final results, the optimal choice of the iterative matrix in the predictor and the number of integration points in the interface elements.

We start by providing an overview of the existing quasi-static and dynamic phase-field fracture formulations from the physics and the mechanics communities. Within the formulations stemming from Griffith’s theory, we focus on quasi-static models featuring a tension-compression split, which prevent cracking in compression and interpenetration of the crack faces upon closure, and on the staggered algorithmic implementation due to its proved robustness. In this paper, we establish an appropriate stopping criterion for the staggered scheme. Moreover, we propose and test the so-called hybrid formulation, which leads within a staggered implementation to an incrementally linear problem. This enables a significant reduction of computational cost—about one order of magnitude—with respect to the available (non-linear) models. The conceptual and structural similarities of the hybrid formulation to gradient-enhanced continuum damage mechanics are outlined as well. Several benchmark problems are solved, including one with own experimental verification.},

Quadrilateral and triangular are treated in a unified fashion. Because we restrict the local refinement to be regular, the resulting finite element systems are always sparse, and the refinement algorithms can be implemented efficiently, in time proportional to the number of elements.  1. Introduction. The finite element method for computing approximate solutions to linear elliptic partial differential equations in the plane [12] is usually considered to have three parts: subspace selection, matrix assembly, and matrix solution. If a particular approximate solution is deemed too inaccurate, improvement may be obtained by selecting a larger subspace, using either mesh refinement or higher-order basis functions. In this paper, we consider various aspects of mesh refinement, particularly in the context of accuracy impr...},

	abstract = {The use of simultaneous multiple plate models offers an attractive and alternative solution to full scale three-dimensional finite element method for the global–local analysis of laminated composite structures. In this paper, an approach is proposed where the less accurate plate model, used to carry out the analysis at the global level, is enhanced by more accurate and complex plate models in each laminate subregion where more accurate transverse stress or strain estimation is required (the local level).

The total displacement is represented as the superposition of the displacements of a number of plate models. By appropriately defining boundaries to the enhancing model/region, it is demonstrated that the superposition of displacements can be used to locally enrich the solution where accurate through-the-thickness stresses are required. In this manner, a computationally efficient global model can be used to determine gross displacements, and potentially the enriched models can be used to determine stresses at lamina interfaces for the accurate prediction of localized phenomena such as damage initiation and growth. The model is implemented combining an extended {FEM} (X-{FEM}) and multilevel mesh superposition approach ({MMSA}). Extra degrees-of-freedom are added to the model to represent the additional displacement fields, and the meshing process remains independent for each field.

The displacements and stresses computed by this approach are compared to literature data and analytical solutions for various plate geometries and loads showing an excellent correlation. Morevoer, the results showed, as expected, that the accuracy of the approximation is improved by the proposed approach compared to using the global plate model alone.},

	abstract = {We investigate various strategies to enforce the kinematics at an embedded interface for transient problems within the extended finite element method. In particular, we focus on explicit time integration of the semi-discrete equations of motion and extend both dual and primal variational frameworks for constraint enforcement to a transient regime. We reiterate the incompatibility of the dual formulation with purely explicit time integration and the severe restrictions placed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Levy condition on primal formulations. We propose an alternate, consistent formulation for the primal method and derive an estimate for the stabilization parameter, which is more amenable in an explicit dynamics framework. Importantly, the use of the new estimate circumvents the need for any tolerances as an interface approaches an element boundary. We also show that with interfacial constraints, existing mass lumping schemes can lead to prohibitively small critical time steps. Accordingly, we propose a mass lumping procedure, which provides a more favorable estimate. These techniques are then demonstrated on several benchmark numerical examples, where we compare and contrast the accuracy of the primal methods against the dual methods in enforcing the constraints.

	abstract = {A new class of time-stepping algorithms for strongly coupled thermomechanical problems is presented which retains the computational convenience of traditional staggered algorithms without upsetting the unconditional stability property characteristic of fully implicit (monolithic) schemes. The proposed schemes proposed schemes are fractional step methods associated with a two phase operator split of the full non-linear system of thermoelasticity into an adiabatic elastodynamics phase, followed by a heat conduction phase at fixed configuration. This operator split is shown to inherit the contractivity property of the full problem of evolution, thus leading to unconditionally B-stable product formula algorithms. In sharp contrast with this stability result, traditional staggered algorithms based on an isothermal mechanical phase followed by a heat conduction phase with an effective heat source are shown to lead, at best, to conditionally stable schemes. It is further shown that the actual implementation of these two classes of schemes is essentially identical. The numerical simulations presented include both dynamic and quasi-static problems and are shown to closely replicate the stability estimates and non-linear stability results derived for these two classes of staggered schemes.},

	abstract = {Finite element methods approximate solutions of partial differential equations by restricting the problem to a finite dimensional function space. In hp adaptive finite element methods, one defines these discrete spaces by choosing different polynomial degrees for the shape functions defined on a locally refined mesh. Although this basic idea is quite simple, its implementation in algorithms and data structures is challenging. It has apparently not been documented in the literature in its most general form. Rather, most existing implementations appear to be for special combinations of finite elements, or for discontinuous Galerkin methods. In this article, we discuss generic data structures and algorithms used in the implementation of hp methods for arbitrary elements, and the complications and pitfalls one encounters. As a consequence, we list the information a description of a finite element has to provide to the generic algorithms for it to be used in an hp context. We support our claim that our reference implementation is efficient using numerical examples in two dimensions and three dimensions, and demonstrate that the hp-specific parts of the program do not dominate the total computing time. This reference implementation is also made available as part of the Open Source deal.{II} finite element library.},

Current algorithms for this facility-elimination, Lagrange multipliers and penalty function methods-are briefly reviewed. An alternative approach is proposed which avoids some of the problems of these methods. This technique uses solution of the unconstrained stiffness equation with an extended number of right-hand sides. The resulting solutions are then combined to satisfy the constraints. This method has application in the synthesis of sub-structures with incompatible boundary variables. It is particularly efficient when the constraint affects many variables but the kinematics of the constraint can be expressed in terms of few independent variables, e.g. rigid body motion of part of the structure. In common with the Lagrange method, it produces data for use in a nonlinear analysis with constraints. The formulation of ‘rigid body’ constraints in geometric nonlinearity is detailed and demonstrated.},

These three ingredients form a basis of a possible practical strategy for computing engineering flows, somewhere between {RANS} and {LES} in complexity. We demonstrate this by solving two challenging incompressible turbulent benchmark problems: channel flow at friction-velocity Reynolds number 2003 and flow in a planar asymmetric diffuser. We observe good agreement between our calculations of mean flow quantities and both reference computations and experimental data. This lends some credence to the proposed approach, which we believe may become a viable engineering tool. },

Engrg 2002; 191:5537–5552), that employs a band of elements adjacent to the boundary. In contrast, the classical fictitious domain method uses Lagrange multipliers on a line (surface) where the boundary condition is to be enforced. The idea can be seen as an extension of the Chimera method of ({ESAIM}: Math. Model Numer. Anal. 2003; 37:495–514), but with a hierarchical representation of the discontinuous solution field. The hierarchical formulation is better suited for moving fictitious boundaries since the stiffness matrix of the underlying structured mesh can be retained during the computations. Our technique allows for optimal convergence properties irrespective of the order of the underlying finite element method. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this method, moving least-squares interpolants are used to construct the trial and test functions for the variational principle (weak form); the dependent variable and its gradient are continuous in the entire domain. In contrast to an earlier formulation by Nayroles and coworkers, certain key differences are introduced in the implementation to increase its accuracy. The numerical examples in this paper show that with these modifications, the method does not exhibit any volumetric locking, the rate of convergence can exceed that of finite elements significantly and a high resolution of localized steep gradients can be achieved. The moving least-squares interpolants and the choices of the weight function are also discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {The combined potential of hydrogels and rapid prototyping technologies has been an exciting route in developing tissue engineering scaffolds for the past decade. Hydrogels represent to be an interesting starting material for soft, and lately also for hard tissue regeneration. Their application enables the encapsulation of cells and therefore an increase of the seeding efficiency of the fabricated structures. Rapid prototyping techniques on the other hand, have become an elegant tool for the production of scaffolds with the purpose of cell seeding and/or cell encapsulation. By means of rapid prototyping, one can design a fully interconnected 3-dimensional structure with pre-determined dimensions and porosity. Despite this benefit, some of the rapid prototyping techniques are not or less suitable for the generation of hydrogel scaffolds. In this review, we therefore give an overview on the different rapid prototyping techniques suitable for the processing of hydrogel materials. A primary distinction will be made between (i) laser-based, (ii) nozzle-based, and (iii) printer-based systems. Special attention will be addressed to current trends and limitations regarding the respective techniques. Each of these techniques will be further discussed in terms of the different hydrogel materials used so far. One major drawback when working with hydrogels is the lack of mechanical strength. Therefore, maintaining and improving the mechanical integrity of the processed scaffolds has become a key issue regarding 3-dimensional hydrogel structures. This limitation can either be overcome during or after processing the scaffolds, depending on the applied technology and materials.},

	abstract = {While micro-{FE} simulations have become a standard tool in computational biomechanics, the choice of appropriate material properties is still a relevant topic, typically involving empirical grey value-to-elastic modulus relations. We here derive the voxel-specific volume fractions of mineral, collagen, and water, from tissue-independent bilinear relations between mineral and collagen content in extracellular bone tissue (J. Theor. Biol. 287: 115, 2011), and from the measured X-ray attenuation information quantified in terms of grey values. The aforementioned volume fractions enter a micromechanics representation of bone tissue, as to deliver voxel-specific stiffness tensors. In order to check the relevance of this strategy, we convert a micro Computer Tomograph of a mouse femur into a regular Finite Element mesh, apply forces related to the dead load of a standing mouse, and then compare simulation results based on voxel-specific heterogeneous elastic properties to results based on homogeneous elastic properties related to the spatial average over the solid bone matrix compartment, of the X-ray attenuation coefficients. The element-specific strain energy density illustrates that use of homogeneous elastic properties implies overestimation of the organ stiffness. Moreover, the simulation reveals large tensile normal stresses throughout the femur neck, which may explain the mouse femur neck's trabecular morphology being quite different from the human case, where the femur neck bears compressive forces and bending moments.},

The numerical results indicate that for 2D and 3D continuum, locking can be avoided. New plate and shell formulations that avoid both shear and membrane locking are also briefly reviewed. The principle is then extended to partition of unity enrichment to simplify numerical integration of discontinuous approximations in the extended finite element method. Examples are presented to test the new elements for problems involving cracks in linear elastic continua and cracked plates. In the latter case, the proposed formulation suppresses locking and yields elements which behave very well, even in the thin plate limit. Two important features of the set of elements presented are their insensitivity to mesh distortion and a lower computational cost than standard finite elements for the same accuracy. These elements are easily implemented in existing codes since they only require the modification of the discretized gradient operator, B.},

This greatly reduces implementation complexity. In this work, we extend a phase-field model for quasi-static brittle fracture to the dynamic case. We introduce a phase-field approximation to the Lagrangian for discrete fracture problems and derive the coupled system of equations that govern the motion of the body and evolution of the phase-field. We study the behavior of the model in one dimension and show how it influences material properties. For the temporal discretization of the equations of motion, we present both a monolithic and staggered time integration scheme. We study the behavior of the dynamic model by performing a number of two and three dimensional numerical experiments. We also introduce a local adaptive refinement strategy and study its performance in the context of locally refined T-splines. We show that the combination of the phase-field model and local adaptive refinement provides an effective method for simulating fracture in three dimensions.},

The arising linear systems are solved iteratively by the conjugate gradient method provided with a multilevel preconditioner. Here, the accuracy of the iterative solution is coupled with the discretization error. As the performance of hierarchical bases preconditioners deteriorates in three space dimensions, the {BPX} preconditioner is used, taking special care of an efficient implementation. Reliable a posteriori estimates for the discretization error are derived from a local comparison with the approximation resulting from piecewise quadratic elements. To illustrate the theoretical results, we consider a familiar model problem involving reentrant corners and a real-life problem arising from hyperthermia, a recent clinical method for cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Applying additive manufacturing technology to the principles of fibre reinforcement of hydrogels, we have fashioned weak hydrogels into mechanically enhanced composites. We combined the extracellular matrix-like structure of gelatin-methacrylamide ({GelMA}) and {GelMA}/hyaluronic acid-methacrylamide ({HAMA}) hydrogels with highly oriented poly(ε-caprolactone) ({PCL}) fibres fabricated by Melt Electrospinning Writing ({MEW}) to achieve fibre-reinforced {GelMA}/{HAMA} composites with improved compressive properties. Stacked fibres with lay-down patterns of 0°–90° and 0°–60°–120°, and spacing of 400 and 800 μm were prepared by {MEW}. These defined fibrous structures were infiltrated with hydrogels, namely {GelMA} (10\%) and {GelMA}/{HAMA} (0.125\%, 0.25\% and 0.5\%) in custom-made moulds and crosslinked by a reduction–oxidation initiating system (ammonium persulphate/tetramethylethylenediamine). Mechanical properties and deformation characteristics of the constructs were evaluated under uniaxial compression loading conducted at 37 °C in culture media with an integrated camera. Reinforced constructs showed more than a 35-fold-increase of the compressive Young’s modulus. However, the compressive Young’s moduli were highly strain-rate dependent. The fibre reinforcement has a particular impact on the Poisson’s ratio of the composite constructs, decreasing from values of approximately 0.4 to 0.01. The high interfacial surface area between the fibre structure and the hydrogel matrix is believed to be one of the main factors responsible for the significant increase in the mechanical properties of the constructs. In summary, we have found that reinforcement of hydrogels with defined {MEW} fibre architectures achieves an outstanding increase in the mechanical properties at high strain rates.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the interest in the problem of brittle fracture and, in particular, in the theory of cracks has grown appreciably in connection with various technical applications. Numerous investigations have been carried out, enlarging in essential points the classical concepts of cracks and methods of analysis. The qualitative features of the problems of cracks, associated with their peculiar nonlinearity as revealed in these investigations, makes the theory of cracks stand out distinctly from the whole range of problems in terms of the theory of elasticity. The chapter presents a unified view of the way basic problems in the theory of equilibrium cracks are formulated and discusses the results obtained thereby. The object of the theory of equilibrium cracks is the study of the equilibrium of solids in the presence of cracks. However, there exists a fundamental distinction between these two problems, The form of a cavity undergoes only slight changes even under a considerable variation in the load acting on a body, while the cracks whose surface also constitutes a part of the body boundary can expand even with small increase of the load to which the body is subjected.},

The effects of the mechanical properties of the laminate and the reinforcement, notch length, and plate thickness on the transition between the two limiting configurations, notch sensitivity and mechanical behavior are analyzed.

	abstract = {Crack growth initiation and subsequent resistance is computed for an elastic-plastic solid with an idealized traction -separation law specified on the crack plane to characterize the fracture process. The solid is specified by its Young's modulus,E, Poisson's ratio, v, initial tensile yield stress, σY,and strain hardening exponent,N. The primary parameters specifying the traction—separation law of the fracture process are the work of separation per unit area, Γ0, and the peak traction, σ\&amp;\#x030C;gs. Highly refined calculations have been carried out for resistance curves, {KR}(Δa), for plane strain, mode I growth in small-scale yielding as dependent on the parameters characterizing the elastic-plastic properties of the solid and its fracture process. With K0= [Eγ0(1 − v2)]12 as the intensity needed to advance the crack in the absence of plasticity, {KRK}0 is presented in terms of its dependence on the two most important parameters, σ̌σY and N, with special emphasis on initiation toughness and steady-state toughness. Three applications of the results are made : to predict toughnesss when the fracture process is void growth and coalescence, to predict the role of plasticity on interface toughness for similar materials bonded together, and to illuminate the role of plasticity in enhancing toughness in dual-phase solids. The regime of applicability of the present model to ductile fracture due to void growth and coalescence, wherein multiple voids interact within the fracture process zone, is complementary to the regime of applicability of models describing the interaction between a single void and the crack tip. The two mechanism regimes are delineated and the consequence of a transition between them is discussed.},

In the experimental phase of the study, coherent gradient sensing ({CGS}) has been used to study dynamic fracture in C300 maraging steel. The specimens were subjected to three-point bend impact loading under a drop weight tower. High-speed photographs of the {CGS} interferograms were analyzed to determine the crack tip location, the velocity and the dynamic fracture toughness as a function of time. Post-mortem examination of the specimens revealed the fractography of the fracture surfaces, including the development of shear lips. In a parallel numerical phase of the study, fracture has been modeled by recourse to an irreversible cohesive law embedded into cohesive elements. These cohesive elements govern all aspects of the separation and closure of the incipient cracks. The cohesive behavior of the material is assumed to be rate independent. The finite element model is three dimensional and consists of quadratic ten-noded tetrahedra. The numerical simulations have proven highly predictive of a number of observed features, including: the crack growth initiation time; the trajectory of the propagating crack tip; and the formation of shear lips near the lateral surfaces. The simulations therefore establish the feasibility of using cohesive models of fracture and cohesive elements to predict dynamic crack-growth initiation and propagation in three dimensions.},

	abstract = {A cohesive formulation of fracture is taken as a basis for the simulation of processes of combined tension-shear damage and mixed-mode fracture in specimens subjected to dynamic loading. Our three-dimensional finite-element calculations account explicitly for crack nucleation, microcracking, the development of macroscopic cracks and inertia. In particular, a tension-shear damage coupling arises as a direct consequence of slanted microcrack formation in the process zone. We valiyear the model against the three-point-bend concrete beam experiments of Guo et al. (International Journal of Solids and Structures 1995; 32(17/18):2951–2607), John ({PhD} Thesis, Northwestern University, 1988), and John and Shah (Journal of Structural Engineering 1990; 116(3):585–602) in which a pre-crack is shifted from the central cross-section, leading to asymmetric loading conditions and the development of a mixed-mode process zone. The model accurately captures the experimentally observed fracture patterns and displacement fields, as well as crack paths and crack-tip velocities, as a function of pre-crack geometry and loading conditions. In particular, it correctly accounts for the competition between crack-growth and nucleation mechanisms. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Cohesive elements are introduced along the boundaries of the inner layers and inside the transverse plies to simulate the spontaneous initiation and propagation of transverse matrix cracks and delamination fronts. The analysis is performed within the framework of the finite deformation theory of elasticity to account for the nonlinear stiffening of the thin composite plate and the large rotations which accompany the fracture process. The simulation is dynamic and uses an explicit time stepping scheme. Comparison with existing experiments performed on graphite/epoxy laminates indicates that the cohesive/volumetric finite element scheme is able to capture the complex mechanisms leading to the delamination, including the initial micro-cracking of the matrix, the appearance of critical transverse matrix cracks and the rapid propagation of delamination cracks initiated at the intersections between the critical matrix cracks and the adjacent plies.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a geometrically flexible technique for computational fluid–structure interaction ({FSI}). The motivating application is the simulation of tri-leaflet bioprosthetic heart valve function over the complete cardiac cycle. Due to the complex motion of the heart valve leaflets, the fluid domain undergoes large deformations, including changes of topology. The proposed method directly analyzes a spline-based surface representation of the structure by immersing it into a non-boundary-fitted discretization of the surrounding fluid domain. This places our method within an emerging class of computational techniques that aim to capture geometry on non-boundary-fitted analysis meshes. We introduce the term “immersogeometric analysis” to identify this paradigm.

The framework starts with an augmented Lagrangian formulation for {FSI} that enforces kinematic constraints with a combination of Lagrange multipliers and penalty forces. For immersed volumetric objects, we formally eliminate the multiplier field by substituting a fluid–structure interface traction, arriving at Nitsche’s method for enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on object surfaces. For immersed thin shell structures modeled geometrically as surfaces, the tractions from opposite sides cancel due to the continuity of the background fluid solution space, leaving a penalty method. Application to a bioprosthetic heart valve, where there is a large pressure jump across the leaflets, reveals shortcomings of the penalty approach. To counteract steep pressure gradients through the structure without the conditioning problems that accompany strong penalty forces, we resurrect the Lagrange multiplier field. Further, since the fluid discretization is not tailored to the structure geometry, there is a significant error in the approximation of pressure discontinuities across the shell. This error becomes especially troublesome in residual-based stabilized methods for incompressible flow, leading to problematic compressibility at practical levels of refinement. We modify existing stabilized methods to improve performance.

To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods, we test them on benchmark problems and compare the results with those of established boundary-fitted techniques. Finally, we simulate the coupling of the bioprosthetic heart valve and the surrounding blood flow under physiological conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in practical computations.},

It is hoped that this approach comprises a good amount of the existing literature by including most concepts in a generic format.

	abstract = {Vertebral fractures represent a major health problem and involve the progressive collapse of trabecular bone over large compressive strains. This collapse is driven by local failure and interaction of the trabecular rod and plate elements, which translates into stress softening and densification at the material level. Current constitutive models for trabecular bone are essentially limited to infinitesimal strains. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to extend our current phenomenological model of trabecular bone (Garcia et al., 2009) for the simulation of large compressive strains by including post-yield softening and densification. A constitutive model of trabecular bone based on both volume fraction and trabecular orientation was formulated in a proper theoretical framework, implemented in commercial {FE} software and valiyeard with human vertebral sections subjected to large compressive strains. As it is for infinitesimal strains, the evolution of plastic strains and damage is described by local internal variables. An isotropic softening rule was controlled by the cumulated plastic strain and a non-linear elastic spring was added to account for densification of the porous material in moderate-to-large compressive strains beyond a given threshold. To avoid convergence problems occurring as a result of softening, a consistent visco-plastic regularization approach was adopted.

The experimental results for 37 vertebral sections from previous work (Dall'Ara et al., 2010) were used to valiyear the constitutive model for compressive loading up to 45\% of the average axial deformation. This validation study showed that the model provides both qualitative predictions of damage localization on the cortex and quantitative predictions of dissipated energy ( ρ C = 0.912 ) of vertebral body behavior under large compressive strains. Since the evolution of the internal variables was considered in local manner, a mesh sensitivity analysis of the finite element model was conducted via two different mesh sizes and revealed that strain localization was dominated by trabecular bone heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this model is the first to simulate collapse of trabecular bone and may help improve the biomechanical understanding of several musculoskeletal conditions such as vertebral fractures or orthopedic implant migration.},

	abstract = {Continuum finite element ({FE}) models are standard tools for determination of biomechanical properties of bones and bone-implant systems. This study investigates the accuracy of an enhanced continuum {FE} model by taking μ {FE} as the gold standard. The enhanced continuum models account for trabecular bone morphology (density and fabric) as well as for an anatomically correct cortical shell. Vertebral body slice models are extracted from high-resolution {CT} images using an algorithm proposed in [Pahr and Zysset, 2008b. From high-resolution {CT} data to {FE} models: development of an integrated modular framework. Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, in press.]. Three different models are generated: the proposed enhanced density-fabric-based model with a subject-specific cortex and two classical isotropic density-only models, with and without explicit modeling of the cortical shell. The material property errors of the used morphology-elasticity relationship are minimized by using elasticity tensors from 60 cubical μ {FE} models which are cropped from the trabecular centrums of the investigated vertebral bodies. Two different boundary conditions—kinematic [Van Rietbergen et al., 1995. A new method to determine trabecular bone elastic properties and loading using micromechanical {FE} models. Journal of Biomechanics 28 (1), 69–81] and mixed [Pahr, D.H., Zysset, P.K., 2008a. Influence of boundary conditions on computed apparent elastic properties of cancellous bone. Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology 7, 463–476.]—are used in these {FE} models. After removal of the endplates, compressive and antero–posterior shear loading is applied on the investigated vertebral bodies. Individual error sources are studied in more detail by loading also the trabecular centrum (removed shell) and the cortical shell alone. It is found that the cortex-only models need a correction of the shell thickness when transforming from a voxel to a smooth description. The trabecular centrum alone gives too stiff and too soft a response using material calibration with kinematic and mixed boundary conditions, respectively. A comparison of the whole vertebral body stiffnesses shows that an orthotropic cancellous bone material calibrated with kinematic boundary conditions corresponds best with μ {FE} . Taken together, the proposed enhanced homogenized surface-based {FE} model is structurally more accurate than density-only models.},

To evaluate the differences in predicted fracture strength of osteoporotic vertebral bodies among the different loading conditions that are occurring in the activities of daily living., Summary of Background Data. {FE} model has been reported to predict vertebral strength in uniaxial loading, but forward bending load plays an important role in osteoporotic vertebral fractures., Methods. Strengths of the second lumbar vertebra in 41 female patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis were analyzed using a nonlinear {CT}-based {FE} method. Three different loading conditions were adopted uniaxial compression, forward bending, and erect standing. The same boundary condition was used for all loading conditions. Predicted strengths under forward bending and erect standing were compared with that under uniaxial compression and differences in strength were statistically analyzed., Results. The regression equation relating strength under uniaxial compression to that under erect standing was expressed as y = 0.8912x + 19.332 (R = 0.9522), whereas the equation relating uniaxial compression to forward bending was y = 0.7033x + 55.071 (R = 0.8342). Both relationships were significant, but the correlation between forward bending and uniaxial compression was not strong, while strength was lower under forward bending than under uniaxial compression according to the Friedman multiple comparison test (P = 0.00017)., Conclusion. Strength under forward bending correlated significantly to that under uniaxial compression, but the correlation was not strong. Therefore, in osteoporotic patients, both uniaxial compression and forward bending should be assessed to evaluate fracture risk in daily living using a {CT}-based {FE} method., (C) 2009 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

The same {FE} models with inhomogeneous orthotropic material properties produce results similar to those obtained with isotropic material properties. Herein, we investigate the yield prediction capabilities of these models using four different yield criteria, and the spread in the predicted load between the isotropic and orthotropic material models. Subject-specific high-order {FE} models of two human femurs were generated from {CT} scans with inhomogeneous orthotropic or isotropic material properties, and loaded by a simple compression force at the head. Computed strains and stresses by both the orthotropic and isotropic {FE} models were used to determine the load that predicts ‘yielding’ by four different ‘yield criteria’: von Mises, Drucker–Prager, maximum principal stress and maximum principal strain. One of the femurs was loaded by a simple load until fracture, and the force resulting in yielding was compared with the {FE} predicted force. The surface average of the ‘maximum principal strain’ criterion in conjunction with the orthotropic {FE} model best predicts both the yield force and fracture location compared with other criteria. There is a non-negligible influence on the predictions if orthotropic or isotropic material properties are applied to the {FE} model. All stress-based investigated ‘yield criteria’ have a small spread in the predicted failure. Because only one experiment was performed with a rather simplified loading configuration, the conclusions of this work cannot be claimed to be either reliable or sufficient, and future experiments should be performed to further substantiate the conclusions.},

	abstract = {Background
Finite element models of augmented vertebral bodies require a realistic modelling of the cement infiltrated region. Most methods published so far used idealized cement shapes or oversimplified material models for the augmented region. In this study, an improved, anatomy-specific, homogenized finite element method was developed and valiyeard to predict the apparent as well as the local mechanical behavior of augmented vertebral bodies.
Methods
Forty-nine human vertebral body sections were prepared by removing the cortical endplates and scanned with high-resolution peripheral quantitative {CT} before and after injection of a standard and a low-modulus bone cement. Forty-one specimens were tested in compression to measure stiffness, strength and contact pressure distributions between specimens and loading-plates. From the remaining eight, fourteen cylindrical specimens were extracted from the augmented region and tested in compression to obtain material properties. Anatomy-specific finite element models were generated from the {CT} data. The models featured element-specific, density-fabric-based material properties, damage accumulation, real cement distributions and experimentally determined material properties for the augmented region. Apparent stiffness and strength as well as contact pressure distributions at the loading plates were compared between simulations and experiments.
Findings
The finite element models were able to predict apparent stiffness (R2 \&gt; 0.86) and apparent strength (R2 \&gt; 0.92) very well. Also, the numerically obtained pressure distributions were in reasonable quantitative (R2 \&gt; 0.48) and qualitative agreement with the experiments.
Interpretation
The proposed finite element models have proven to be an accurate tool for studying the apparent as well as the local mechanical behavior of augmented vertebral bodies.},

Longitudinal acoustic waves are sent in longitudinal (superior-inferior, axial) as well as transverse (circumferential) direction through millimeter-sized samples containing this vertebral cortex, and corresponding wave velocities agree very well with recently identified ‘universal’ compositional and acoustic characteristics (J Theor Biol 287:115, 2011), which are valid for a large data base comprising different bones from different species and different organs.

The {OPTAMISE} (Open-label Study to Determine How Prior Therapy with Alendronate or Risedronate in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis Influences the Clinical Effectiveness of Teriparatide) study reported greater increases in biochemical markers of bone turnover and volumetric bone mineral density ({BMD}) when 12 months of teriparatide treatment was preceded by 2 years or more of risedronate versus alendronate treatment. The objective of this study was to use quantitative computed tomography ({CT})-based nonlinear finite element modeling to evaluate how prior therapy with alendronate or risedronate in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis influences the biomechanical effectiveness of teriparatide. Finite element models of the L1 vertebra were created from quantitative {CT} scans, acquired before and after 12 months of therapy with teriparatide, from 171 patients from the {OPTAMISE} study. These models were subjected to uniaxial compression. Total {BMD}-derived bone volume fraction ({BV}/{TVd}, i.e., bone volume [{BV}]/total volume [{TV}]), estimated from quantitative {CT}-based volumetric {BMD}, vertebral stiffness, and failure load (strength) were calculated for each time measurement point. The results of this study demonstrated that 12 months of treatment with teriparatide following prior treatment with either risedronate or alendronate increased {BMD}-derived {BV}/{TVd}, the predicted vertebral stiffness, and failure load. However, the effects of teriparatide were more pronounced in patients treated previously with risedronate, which is consistent with the findings of the {OPTAMISE} study. The mean (± standard error) increase in stiffness was greater in the prior risedronate group than the prior alendronate group (24.6 ± 3.2\% versus 14.4 ± 2.8\%, respectively; p = 0.0073). Similarly, vertebral failure load increased by 27.2 ± 3.5\% in the prior risedronate group versus 15.3 ± 3.1\% in the prior alendronate group (p = 0.0042). The mechanical variables increased in greater proportion than {BV}/{TVd}, which increased by 6.9 ± 0.9\% versus 4.6 ± 0.8\% in the prior-risedronate and prior-alendronate groups, respectively (p = 0.0290). Our finding indicated that while teriparatide can be used with success on patients who have previously undergone treatment with risedronate and alendronate, it demonstrated greater anabolic effect on biomechanical properties in prior-risedronate patients in the first year of teriparatide treatment.},

	abstract = {Quantitative computer tomography ({QCT})-based finite element ({FE}) models of vertebral body provide better prediction of vertebral strength than dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. However, most models were valiyeard against compression of vertebral bodies with endplates embedded in polymethylmethalcrylate ({PMMA}). Yet, loading being as important as bone density, the absence of intervertebral disc ({IVD}) affects the strength. Accordingly, the aim was to assess the strength predictions of the classic {FE} models (vertebral body embedded) against the in vitro and in silico strengths of vertebral bodies loaded via {IVDs}. High resolution peripheral {QCT} ({HR}-{pQCT}) were performed on 13 segments (T11/T12/L1). T11 and L1 were augmented with {PMMA} and the samples were tested under a 4° wedge compression until failure of T12. Specimen-specific model was generated for each T12 from the {HR}-{pQCT} data. Two {FE} sets were created: {FE}-{PMMA} refers to the classical vertebral body embedded model under axial compression; {FE}-{IVD} to their loading via hyperelastic {IVD} model under the wedge compression as conducted experimentally. Results showed that {FE}-{PMMA} models overestimated the experimental strength and their strength prediction was satisfactory considering the different experimental set-up. On the other hand, the {FE}-{IVD} models did not prove significantly better (Exp/{FE}-{PMMA}: R²=0.68; Exp/{FE}-{IVD}: R²=0.71, p=0.84). In conclusion, {FE}-{PMMA} correlates well with in vitro strength of human vertebral bodies loaded via real {IVDs} and {FE}-{IVD} with hyperelastic {IVDs} do not significantly improve this correlation. Therefore, it seems not worth adding the {IVDs} to vertebral body models until fully valiyeard patient-specific {IVD} models become available.},

	abstract = {Vertebral strength, a key etiologic factor of osteoporotic fracture, may be affected by the relative amount of vertically oriented trabeculae. To better understand this issue, we performed experimental compression testing, high-resolution micro–computed tomography (µ{CT}), and micro–finite-element analysis on 16 elderly human thoracic ninth (T9) whole vertebral bodies (ages 77.5 ± 10.1 years). Individual trabeculae segmentation of the µ{CT} images was used to classify the trabeculae by their orientation. We found that the bone volume fraction ({BV}/{TV}) of just the vertical trabeculae accounted for substantially more of the observed variation in measured vertebral strength than did the bone volume fraction of all trabeculae (r2 = 0.83 versus 0.59, p {\textless} .005). The bone volume fraction of the oblique or horizontal trabeculae was not associated with vertebral strength. Finite-element analysis indicated that removal of the cortical shell did not appreciably alter these trends; it also revealed that the major load paths occur through parallel columns of vertically oriented bone. Taken together, these findings suggest that variation in vertebral strength across individuals is due primarily to variations in the bone volume fraction of vertical trabeculae. The vertical tissue fraction, a new bone quality parameter that we introduced to reflect these findings, was both a significant predictor of vertebral strength alone (r2 = 0.81) and after accounting for variations in total bone volume fraction in multiple regression (total R2 = 0.93). We conclude that the vertical tissue fraction is a potentially powerful microarchitectural determinant of vertebral strength. © 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of osteoporosis therapy based solely on {DXA} is insufficient to assess antifracture efficacy. Estimating bone strength as a variable closely linked to fracture risk is therefore of importance. Finite element ({FE}) analysis–based strength measures were used to monitor a teriparatide therapy and the associated effects on whole bone and local fracture risk. In 44 postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis participating in the {EUROFORS} study, {FE} models based on high-resolution {CT} ({HRCT}) of T12 were evaluated after 0, 6, 12, and 24 mo of teriparatide treatment (20 μg/d). {FE}-based strength and stiffness calculations for three different load cases (compression, bending, and combined compression and bending) were compared with volumetric {BMD} ({vBMD}) and apparent bone volume fraction (app. {BV}/{TV}), as well as {DXA}-based areal {BMD} of the lumbar spine. Local damage of the bone tissue was also modeled. Highly significant improvements in all analyzed variables as early as 6 mo after starting teriparatide were found. After 24 mo, bone strength in compression was increased by 28.1 ± 4.7\% ({SE}), in bending by 28.3 ± 4.9\%, whereas app. {BV}/{TV} was increased by 54.7 ± 8.8\%, {vBMD} by 19.1 ± 4.0\%, and areal {BMD} of L1–L4 by 10.2 ± 1.2\%. When comparing standardized increases, {FE} changes were significantly larger than those of densitometry and not significantly different from app. {BV}/{TV}. The size of regions at high risk for local failure was significantly reduced under teriparatide treatment. Treatment with teriparatide leads to bone strength increases for different loading conditions of close to 30\%. {FE} is a suitable tool for monitoring bone anabolic treatment in groups or individual patients and offers additional information about local failure modes. {FE} variables showed a higher standardized response to changes than {BMD} measurements, but further studies are needed to show that the higher response represents a more accurate estimate of treatment-induced fracture risk reduction.},

	abstract = {Vertebral fractures are more strongly associated with specific bone density, structure, and strength parameters than with areal {BMD}, but all of these variables are correlated. Introduction: It is unclear whether the association of areal {BMD} ({aBMD}) with vertebral fracture risk depends on bone density per se, bone macro- or microstructure, overall bone strength, or spine load/bone strength ratios. Materials and Methods: From an age-stratified sample of Rochester, {MN}, women, we identified 40 with a clinically diagnosed vertebral fracture (confirmed semiquantitatively) caused by moderate trauma (cases; mean age, 78.6 ± 9.0 yr) and compared them with 40 controls with no osteoporotic fracture (mean age, 70.9 ± 6.8 yr). Lumbar spine volumetric {BMD} ({vBMD}) and geometry were assessed by central {QCT}, whereas microstructure was evaluated by high-resolution {pQCT} at the ultradistal radius. Vertebral failure load (∼strength) was estimated from voxel-based finite element models, and the factor-of-risk (ϕ) was determined as the ratio of applied spine loads to failure load. Results: Spine loading (axial compressive force on L3) was similar in vertebral fracture cases and controls (e.g., for 90° forward flexion, 2639 versus 2706 N; age-adjusted p = 0.173). However, fracture cases had inferior values for most bone density and structure variables. Bone strength measures were also reduced, and the factor-of-risk was 35–37\% greater (worse) among women with a vertebral fracture. By age-adjusted logistic regression, relative risks for the strongest fracture predictor in each of the five main variable categories were bone density (total lumbar spine {vBMD}: {OR} per {SD} change, 2.2; 95\% {CI}, 1.1–4.3), bone geometry (vertebral apparent cortical thickness: {OR}, 2.1; 95\% {CI}, 1.1–4.1), bone microstructure (none significant); bone strength (“cortical” [outer 2 mm] compressive strength: {OR}, 2.5; 95\% {CI}, 1.3–4.8), and factor-of-risk (ϕ for 90° forward flexion/overall vertebral compressive strength: {OR}, 3.2; 95\% {CI}, 1.4–7.5). These variables were correlated with spine {aBMD} (partial r, −0.32 to 0.75), but each was a stronger predictor of fracture in the logistic regression analyses. Conclusions: The association of {aBMD} with vertebral fracture risk is explained by its correlation with more specific bone density, structure, and strength parameters. These may allow deeper insights into fracture pathogenesis.},

These granules need to provide enough porous space for bone ingrowth, while maintaining sufficient mechanical competence (stiffness and strength) in this highly load-bearing organ. This double challenge motivates us to scrutinize more deeply the micro- and nanomechanical characteristics of such globules, as to identify possible optimization routes. Therefore, we imaged such a (pre-cracked) granule in a {microCT} scanner, transformed the attenuation coefficients into voxel-specific nanoporosities, from which we determined, via polycrystal micromechanics, voxel-specific (heterogeneous) elastic properties. The importance of the latter and of the presence of one to several hundred micrometers-sized cracks for realistically estimating the load-carrying behavior of the globule under a typical two-point compressive loading (as in a “splitting” test) is shown through results of large-scale Finite Element analyses, in comparison to analytical results for a sphere loaded at its poles: Use of homogeneous instead of heterogeneous elastic properties would overestimate the structure's stiffness by 5\% (when employing a micromechanics-based process as to attain homogeneous properties)—the cracks, in comparison, weaken the structure by one to two orders of magnitudes.},

Patient-specific nonlinear finite element ({FE}) models have shown promise in predicting yield strength and damage pattern but have not been experimentally valiyeard for clinically relevant vertebral fractures, which involve loading through intervertebral discs with varying degrees of degeneration up to large compressive strains. Therefore, stepwise axial compression was applied in vitro on segments and performed in silico on their {FE} equivalents using a nonlocal damage-plastic model including densification at large compression for bone and a time-independent hyperelastic model for the disc. The ability of the nonlinear {FE} models to predict the failure pattern in large compression was evaluated for three boundary conditions: healthy and degenerated intervertebral discs and embedded endplates. Bone compaction and fracture patterns were predicted using the local volume change as an indicator and the best correspondence was obtained for the healthy intervertebral discs. These preliminary results show that nonlinear finite element models enable prediction of bone localisation and compaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the collapse of osteoporotic vertebral bodies up to large compression using realistic loading via the intervertebral discs.},

	abstract = {{SummaryObjective}
To investigate the relevance of the human vertebral endplate poromechanics on the fluid and metabolic transport from and to the intervertebral disc ({IVD}) based on educated estimations of the poromechanical parameter values of the bony endplate ({BEP}).
Methods
50 micro-models of different {BEP} samples were generated from μ{CTs} of lumbar vertebrae and allowed direct determination of porosity values. Permeability values were calculated by using the micro-models, through the simulation of permeation via computational fluid dynamics. These educated ranges of porosity and permeability values were used as inputs for mechano-transport simulations to assess their effect on both the distributions of metabolites within an {IVD} model and the poromechanical calculations within the cartilaginous part of the endplate i.e., the cartilage endplate ({CEP}).
Results
{BEP} effective permeability was highly correlated to local variations of porosity (R2 ≈ 0.88). Universal patterns between bone volume fraction and permeability arose from these results and from other experimental data in the literature. These variations in {BEP} permeability and porosity had negligible effects on the distributions of metabolites within the disc. In the {CEP}, the variability of the poromechanical properties of the {BEP} did not affect the predicted consolidation but induced higher fluid velocities.
Conclusions
The present paper provides the first sets of thoroughly identified {BEP} parameter values that can be further used in patient-specific poromechanical studies. Representing {BEP} structural changes through variations in poromechanical properties did not affect the diffusion of metabolites. However, attention might be paid to alterations in fluid velocities and cell mechano-sensing within the {CEP}.},

	abstract = {Two general algorithms for refining triangular computational meshes based on the bisection of triangles by the longest side are presented and discussed. The algorithms can be applied globally or locally for selective refinement of any conforming triangulation and always generate a new conforming triangulation after a finite number of interactions even when locally used. The algorithms also ensure that all angles in subsequent refined triangulations are greater than or equal to half the smallest angle in the original triangulation; the shape regularity of all triangles is maintained and the transition between small and large triangles is smooth in a natural way. Proofs of the above properties are presented. The second algorithm is a simpler, improved version of the first which retains most of the properties of the latter. The algorithms can be used either for constructing irregular computational meshes or for locally refining any given triangulation. In this sense they can be adequately combined with adaptive and/or multigrid techniques for solving finite element systems. Examples of the application of the algorithms are given and two possible generalizations are pointed out.},

finite element method for solving elliptic and electromagnetic problems described
by partial differential equations in three spatial dimensions. Besides the standard
element refinements, the hp-adaptivity allows independent adaptation of degrees
of the polynomial approximation as well. This leads to exponentially fast conver-
gence even for problems with singularities. The efficiency of the hp-adaptivity
is enhanced even more by the ability of the algorithm to work with meshes with
arbitrary-level hanging nodes. This generality, however, leads to great complex-
ity of the implementation. Therefore, the thesis concentrates on the mathematical
analysis of algorithms that have led to successful implementation of the method.
In addition, the thesis discusses the numerical integration in 3D and the implemen-
tation of the method itself. Finally, numerical results obtained by this new imple-
mentation are presented. They confirm advantages of hp-adaptivity on meshes
with arbitrary-level hanging nodes.},

Since the electric field E and temperature field T are very different in nature, they are approximated on individual meshes that change dynamically in time, independently of each other. Although the approximations of E and T are defined on different meshes, the coupling is treated in a monolithic fashion using a complex-valued approximate temperature. Numerical experiments are presented that show the novel method is clearly superior to its natural competitors—the space and time adaptive (single mesh) hp-finite element method and the space and time adaptive two-mesh h-finite element method. In all cases, comparisons in both the number of degrees of freedom (discrete problem size) and {CPU} time are presented. The methodology is freely available on-line in the form of a general public licensed C++/Python library Hermes (http://hpfem.org/).},

	abstract = {In linear thermoelasticity models, the temperature T and the displacement components u1,u2 exhibit large qualitative differences: while T typically is very smooth everywhere in the domain, the displacements u1,u2 have singular gradients (stresses) at re-entrant corners and edges. The mesh must be extremely fine in these areas so that stress intensity factors are resolved sufficiently. One of the best available methods for this task is the exponentially-convergent hp-{FEM}. Note, however, that standard adaptive hp-{FEM} approximates all three fields u1,u2 and T on the same mesh, and thus it treats T as if it were singular at re-entrant corners as well. Therefore, a large number of degrees of freedom of temperature are wasted. This motivates us to approximate the fields u1,u2 and T on individual hp-meshes equipped with mutually independent hp-adaptivity mechanisms. In this paper we describe mathematical and algorithmic aspects of the novel adaptive multimesh hp-{FEM}, and demonstrate numerically that it performs better than the standard adaptive h-{FEM} and hp-{FEM}.},

	abstract = {We adopt a numerical method to solve Poisson's equation on a fixed grid with embedded boundary conditions, where we put a special focus on the accurate representation of the normal gradient on the boundary. The lack of accuracy in the gradient evaluation on the boundary is a common issue with low-order embedded boundary methods. Whereas a direct evaluation of the gradient is preferable, one typically uses post-processing techniques to improve the quality of the gradient. Here, we adopt a new method based on the discontinuous-Galerkin ({DG}) finite element method, inspired by the recent work of [A.J. Lew and G.C. Buscaglia. A discontinuous-Galerkin-based immersed boundary method. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 76:427-454, 2008]. The method has been enhanced in two aspects: firstly, we approximate the boundary shape locally by higher-order geometric primitives. Secondly, we employ higher-order shape functions within intersected elements. These are derived for the various geometric features of the boundary based on analytical solutions of the underlying partial differential equation. The development includes three basic geometric features in two dimensions for the solution of Poisson's equation: a straight boundary, a circular boundary, and a boundary with a discontinuity. We demonstrate the performance of the method via analytical benchmark examples with a smooth circular boundary as well as in the presence of a singularity due to a re-entrant corner. Results are compared to a low-order extended finite element method as well as the {DG} method of [1]. We report improved accuracy of the gradient on the boundary by one order of magnitude, as well as improved convergence rates in the presence of a singular source. In principle, the method can be extended to three dimensions, more complicated boundary shapes, and other partial differential equations. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The method is based on the solution of a small linear system based on a simplified variant of the moment-fitting equations. Numerical experiments suggest that the accuracy of the resulting quadrature rules exceeds the accuracy of traditional methods by orders of magnitude. Using moments up to an order of p, the measured experimental orders of convergence exceed hp. Consequently, their construction is very efficient because only coarse computational grids are required. The conceptual simplicity allows for the application on very general grid types, which is demonstrated by numerical experiments on quadrilateral, triangular and hexahedral grids.

	title = {Reduced-basis based S-{FEM} and G-{FEM} for the efficient simulation of processes involving moving heat sources},
	abstract = {The numerical simulation of manufacturing processes involving moving heat sources such as welding
or surface treatments are of great interest in industry. It allows reducing the design cycle time and
optimizing the process without the need of costly and time consuming test campaigns.
Using traditional finite element methods ({FEM}) to simulate these processes may lead to solve
systems of an enormous number of degrees of freedom with a high computational cost. This fact has
motivated the research for more efficient solutions to address these problems in recent years,
focusing on one key idea: the large temperature gradients are confined to a relatively small area, near
the heat source, compared to the size of the piece (heat affected zone, {HAZ}). Thus, simulations with
a local/global approach [1] or a refinement moving mesh technique [2] can be found in the literature.
The latter strategy is implemented in the widely used commercial code {SYSWELD}.
This paper explores various strategies to increase the efficiency of these simulations using three basic
ingredients: superposition, solution enrichment and reduced-basis. The feasibility of a coupled
formulation between {FE} and reduced-basis was previously studied in [3-4]. The general scheme of
the proposed procedure is as follows. First, a background coarse {FE} discretization is established
along the entire piece. Then, a patch that moves with the heat source is superimposed, covering the
{HAZ} area. At this point, several possibilities can be considered. One option is to introduce a very fine
{FE} discretization, resulting in the so-called s-version of the {FEM} [5] ({FEM}-{FEM} approach). Another
choice can be to construct a moving reduced-basis in the patch using information from experiments
or previous simulations ({FEM}-{POD} approach). Finally, a Generalized Finite Element (G-{FEM})
approach can be followed considering an enriched interpolant on the patch area thanks to the
partition of unity property [6]. These three strategies are compared in terms of robustness and
computational cost.},

Discontinuous p-hierarchical enrichment functions are applied to strongly graded tetrahedral meshes automatically created around crack fronts. The {GFEM} is able to model a crack arbitrarily located within a finite element ({FE}) mesh and thus the proposed method allows fully automated fracture analysis using an existing {FE} discretization without cracks. We also propose a crack surface representation that is independent of the underlying {GFEM} discretization and controlled only by the physics of the problem. The representation preserves continuity of the crack surface while being able to represent non-planar, non-smooth, crack surfaces inside of elements of any size. The proposed representation also provides support for the implementation of accurate, robust, and computationally efficient numerical integration of the weak form over elements cut by the crack surface. Numerical simulations using the proposed {GFEM} show high convergence rates of extracted stress intensity factors along non-planar curved crack fronts and the robustness of the method.

Design. The muscle forces and stresses were calculated using a non-linear finite element model of the lumbar spine.

Background. Little is known about the influence of muscle forces on the deformation of, and stresses in, the lumbar spine. In most studies, muscle forces are neglected.

Methods. Three-dimensional non-linear finite element models of the ligamentous lumbar spine, with and without internal spinal fixators, were created. They were valiyeard by use of experimental data from in vitro measurements on cadaver specimens. In a second step, the influence of muscle forces on stresses in the annulus fibrosus of the lumbar spine discs was investigated in a parameter study. This was done for different inclination angles of the upper-body.

Results. Good agreement between analytical and experimental results proved achievable when loading with pure moments in the three main planes of the lumbar spine. For inclination of the upper-body, the flexion angle clearly has a strong influence on the stresses in the lumbar spine while the influence of local muscles was small. The stress distribution in the discs differed considerably when the muscle forces are neglected and only a pure moment is applied.

Conclusions. This study confirmed earlier ones that have shown that muscle forces should not be neglected when studying the stresses in the lumbar spine. The local dorsal muscles, however, have only a small influence on the stresses in the discs.Relevance

For investigations of the biomechanical effects of spinal implants and surgical procedures, experimental or analytical methods are used. Due to the complexity involved, as well as to a lack of information, muscle forces are often neglected. Our study showed that muscles do in fact have a major influence on the mechanical behaviour of the spine and should always be taken into account.},

	abstract = {Finite element ({FE}) model studies have made important contributions to our understanding of functional biomechanics of the lumbar spine. However, if a model is used to answer clinical and biomechanical questions over a certain population, their inherently large inter-subject variability has to be considered. Current {FE} model studies, however, generally account only for a single distinct spinal geometry with one set of material properties. This raises questions concerning their predictive power, their range of results and on their agreement with in vitro and in vivo values.

Eight well-established {FE} models of the lumbar spine (L1-5) of different research centers around the globe were subjected to pure and combined loading modes and compared to in vitro and in vivo measurements for intervertebral rotations, disc pressures and facet joint forces.

Under pure moment loading, the predicted L1-5 rotations of almost all models fell within the reported in vitro ranges, and their median values differed on average by only 2° for flexion-extension, 1° for lateral bending and 5° for axial rotation. Predicted median facet joint forces and disc pressures were also in good agreement with published median in vitro values. However, the ranges of predictions were larger and exceeded those reported in vitro, especially for the facet joint forces. For all combined loading modes, except for flexion, predicted median segmental intervertebral rotations and disc pressures were in good agreement with measured in vivo values.

In light of high inter-subject variability, the generalization of results of a single model to a population remains a concern. This study demonstrated that the pooled median of individual model results, similar to a probabilistic approach, can be used as an improved predictive tool in order to estimate the response of the lumbar spine.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Verified and valiyeard {CT}-based high-order finite element ({FE}) methods were developed that predict accurately the mechanical response of patient-specific intact femurs. Here we extend these capabilities to human femurs undergoing a total hip replacement using cemented prostheses.
{METHODS}: A fresh-frozen human femur was {CT}-scanned and thereafter in vitro loaded in a stance position until fracture at the neck. The head and neck were removed and the femur was implanted with a cemented prosthesis. The fixed femur was {CT}-scanned and loaded through the prosthesis so that strains and displacements were measured. High-order {FE} models based on the {CT} scans, mimicking the experiments, were constructed to check the simulations prediction capabilities.
{RESULTS}: The {FE} models were verified and results were compared to the experimental observations. The correlation between the experimental and {FE} strains and displacements were (R(2)=0.97, {EXP}=0.96FE+0.02) for the intact femur and (R(2)=0.90, {EXP}=0.946FE+0.0012) for the implanted femur. This is considered a good agreement considering the uncertainties encountered by the heavy distortion embedded in the {CT} scan of the metallic prosthesis.
{DISCUSSION}: The patient-specific {FE} model of the fresh-frozen femur with the cemented metallic prosthesis showed a good correlation to experimental observations, both when considering surface strains, displacements and strains on the prosthesis. The relatively short timescale to generate and analyze such femurs (about 6h) make these analyses a very attractive tool to be used in clinical practice for optimization prostheses (dimensions, location and configuration), and allow to quantify the stress shielding.},

Process variable combinations yielding constant beta grain size and morphology were identified. Comparison with a previously developed process map for melt pool geometry shows that maintaining a constant melt pool cross sectional area will also yield a constant grain size. Additionally, the grain morphology boundaries are similar to curves of constant melt pool aspect ratio. Experimental results support the numerical predictions and identify a proportional size scaling between beta grain widths and melt pool widths.

Through the use of this model, the nucleation and growth of dendrites, the segregation of niobium (Nb) and the formation of Laves phase particles during the solidification are investigated to provide the relationship between the solidification conditions and the resultant microstructure, especially in the morphology of Laves phase particles. The study shows that small equiaxed dendrite arm spacing under a high cooling rate and low temperature gradient to growth rate (G/R) ratio is beneficial for forming discrete Laves phase particles. In contrast, large columnar dendrite arm spacing under a low cooling rate and high G/R ratio tends to produce continuously distributed coarse Laves phase particles, which are known to be detrimental to mechanical properties. In addition, the improvement of hot cracking resistance by controlling the morphology of Laves phase particles is discussed by analyzing the cracking pattern and microstructure in the laser deposited material. This work provides valuable understanding of solidification microstructure development in Nb-bearing nickel-based superalloys, like {IN} 718, during laser additive manufacturing and constitutes a fundamental basis for controlling the microstructure to minimize the formation of deleterious Laves phase particles.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses extended shape optimization problems where structural supports, i.e., Dirichlet boundaries and free boundaries are simultaneously optimized. Unlike traditional {FEM}, the weighted B-spline finite cell method ({FCM}) is applied as structural analysis tool and combined with the level-set function ({LSF}) to take into account Dirichlet boundary condition ({DBC}) automatically through penalization of the displacement field.

The proposed shape optimization method achieves a comprehensive integration of fixed grid, B-spline shape function and level-set function. As both the structure and Dirichlet boundaries are described in the form of {LSF}, any modification of Dirichlet boundaries can be made in a straightforward way as easily as free boundaries by changing continuous design variables. Meanwhile, the computing accuracy is ensured within the framework of fixed grid owing to the quadtree refinements of boundary cells. Stress related shape optimization problems are finally solved to demonstrate the merit and validity of the proposed optimization method in dealing with shape optimization of Dirichlet boundaries.},

	abstract = {Standard methods for predicting bone's mechanical response from quantitative computer tomography ({qCT}) scans are mainly based on classical h-version finite element methods ({FEMs}). Due to the low-order polynomial approximation, the need for segmentation and the simplified approach to assign a constant material property to each element in h-{FE} models, these often compromise the accuracy and efficiency of h-{FE} solutions. Herein, a non-standard method, the finite cell method ({FCM}), is proposed for predicting the mechanical response of the human femur. The {FCM} is free of the above limitations associated with h-{FEMs} and is orders of magnitude more efficient, allowing its use in the setting of computational steering. This non-standard method applies a fictitious domain approach to simplify the modeling of a complex bone geometry obtained directly from a {qCT} scan and takes into consideration easily the heterogeneous material distribution of the various bone regions of the femur. The fundamental principles and properties of the {FCM} are briefly described in relation to bone analysis, providing a theoretical basis for the comparison with the p-{FEM} as a reference analysis and simulation method of high quality. Both p-{FEM} and {FCM} results are valiyeard by comparison with an in vitro experiment on a fresh-frozen femur.},

Taking advantage of the strengths of both techniques, we make {IGA} responsible for the representation of the exact geometry of the problem domain boundary, while the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method ({RKPM}) discretization is employed in the interior of the domain. The coupling procedure relies on the higher-order consistency or reproducing conditions that are directly imposed in the physical domain. The resulting {IGA}–{RKPM} coupling technique preserves the geometric exactness of {IGA} while circumventing the need for global volumetric parameterization of the problem domain, and achieves arbitrary-order approximation accuracy while maintaining higher-order smoothness of the discretization. Numerical examples demonstrate the optimal convergence properties of the coupled {IGA}–{RKPM} formulation, and show its effectiveness in constructing volumetric discretizations for complex-geometry objects.},

The necessity of performing symbolic computation during such transformation is eliminated by using one dimensional Gauss quadrature rule. The facet integrals are computed with the help of quadratures available for triangles and quadrilaterals. Numerical examples, in which the proposed method is used to integrate the weak form of the Navier–Stokes equations in an embedded interface method ({EIM}), are presented. The results show that our method is as accurate and generalized as the most widely used volume decomposition based methods. Moreover, since the method involves neither volume decomposition nor symbolic computations, it is much easier for computer implementation. Also, the present method is more efficient than other available integration methods based on the divergence theorem. Efficiency of the method is also compared with the volume decomposition based methods and moment fitting methods. To our knowledge, this is the first article that compares both accuracy and computational efficiency of methods relying on volume decomposition and those based on the divergence theorem.},

Using linear triangles or tetrahedrals, integration can be performed in a closed analytical way, assuring an exact evaluation of the discrete balance equation. Because of its unconditional stability, an Euler-backward time-stepping scheme is implemented. A crucial fact is the computation of the exact tangent matrices for the Newton–Raphson solution of the non-linear system of discretized equations.

In particular, two problems are considered in this work: the stationary convection–diffusion problem, and the classical transient heat problem. The mathematical models used to solve these problems are based upon enthalpy formulations. The algorithmic design is based on a Newton-type iterative procedure for the stationary problem, and for the transient one, a combination with classical finite difference schemes in time is performed. The proposed phase change algorithmic treatment is applicable for both the situations in which the latent heat takes place over a temperature range or at fixed temperature. Hence, for this latter situation, a regularization over a narrow temperature range is not necessary. The numerical implementation is discussed in detail where we include also the other possible nonlinearities, namely, the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity and the radiation-type boundary conditions. Finally, a set of representative numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method is given.},

	abstract = {Finite element modeling is an engineering tool for structural analysis that has been used for many years to assess the relationship between load transfer and bone morphology and to optimize the design and fixation of orthopedic implants. Due to recent developments in finite element model generation, for example, improved computed tomography imaging quality, improved segmentation algorithms, and faster computers, the accuracy of finite element modeling has increased vastly and finite element models simulating the anatomy and properties of an individual patient can be constructed. Such so-called patient-specific finite element models are potentially valuable tools for orthopedic surgeons in fracture risk assessment or pre- and intraoperative planning of implant placement. The aim of this article is to provide a critical overview of current themes in patient-specific finite element modeling of bones. In addition, the state-of-the-art in patient-specific modeling of bones is compared with the requirements for a clinically applicable patient-specific finite element method, and judgment is passed on the feasibility of application of patient-specific finite element modeling as a part of clinical orthopedic routine. It is concluded that further development in certain aspects of patient-specific finite element modeling are needed before finite element modeling can be used as a routine clinical tool.},

	abstract = {Quantitative computed tomography ({QCT}) based nonlinear homogenized finite element ({hFE}) models of the human femur do not take bone׳s microstructure into account due to the low resolution of the {QCT} images. Models based on high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography ({HR}-{pQCT}) are able to include trabecular orientation and allow the modeling of a cortical shell. Such a model showed improvements compared to {QCT}-based models when studying human vertebral bodies. The goal of this study was to compare the femoral strength prediction ability of subject specific nonlinear homogenized {FE} ({hFE}) models based on {HR}-{pQCT} and {QCT} images.

Thirty-six pairs of femurs were scanned with {QCT} as well as {HR}-{pQCT}, and tested in one-legged stance ({STANCE}) and side-ways fall ({SIDE}) configurations up to failure. Non-linear {hFE} models were generated from {HR}-{pQCT} images (smooth meshes) and compared to recently published {QCT} based models (voxel meshes) as well as experiments with respect to ultimate force.

{HR}-{pQCT}-based {hFE} models improved ultimate force (R2=0.87 vs 0.80, p=0.02) predictions only in {STANCE} configuration but not in {SIDE} (R2=0.86 vs 0.84, p=0.6). Damage locations were similar for both types of models.

In conclusion, it was shown for the first time on a large femur dataset that a more accurate representation of trabecular orientation and cortex only improve {FE} predictions in {STANCE} configuration, where the main trabecular orientation is aligned with the load direction. In the clinically more relevant {SIDE} configuration, the improvements were not significant.},

The simplest scheme is exact for quadratic functions, uses rational linear weighting (“blending”) functions analogous to the methods of Mangeron and Coons for rectangles, and satisfies a maximum principle. For any positive integer p, there is an analogous scheme which interpolates on the boundary to the function and all its partial derivatives of order p − 1. The interpolant satisfies a partial differential equation of order 6p and approximates any sufficiently smooth function to order O(h3p).},

	abstract = {In order to better conform to curved boundaries and material interfaces, curved finite elements have been widely applied in recent years by practicing engineering analysts. The most well known of such elements are the “isoparametric elements”. As Zienkiewicz points out in [18, p. 132] there has been a certain parallel between the development of “element types” as used in finite element analyses and the independent development of methods for the mathematical description of general free-form surfaces. One of the purposes of this paper is to show that the relationship between these two areas of recent mathematical activity is indeed quite intimate. In order to establish this relationship, we introduce the notion of a “transfinite element” which, in brief, is an invertible mapping{\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}vec T{\textbackslash}) from a square parameter {domainJ} onto a closed, bounded and simply connected {regionℛ} in thexy-plane together with a “transfinite” blending-function type interpolant to the dependent variablef defined {overℛ}. The “subparametric”, “isoparametric” and “superparametric” element types discussed by Zienkiewicz in [18, pp. 137–138] can all be shown to be special cases obtainable by various discretizations of transfinite elements Actual error bounds are derived for a wide class of semi-discretized transfinite elements (with the nature of the mapping{\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}vec T{\textbackslash}):J→ℛ remaining unspecified) as applied to two types of boundary value problems. These bounds for semi-discretized elements are then specialized to obtain bounds for the familiar isoparametric elements. While we consider only two dimensional elements, extensions to higher dimensions is straightforward.},

The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods.

The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomoyears several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100.},

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a {CAD} (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection–diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},

First, we develop the entire system of differential–algebraic equations resulting from the spatially discretized principle of virtual displacements, the principle of virtual temperatures, and the evolution equations of the internal variables provided by the constitutive model. In the time-integration step this system is solved both using a fully monolithic approach based on a Backward–Euler scheme in combination with the Multilevel-Newton algorithm as well as a partitioned approach solving the fully coupled system. The latter is treated by means of a combination of a Backward–Euler method and an accelerated Gauss–Seidel/Multilevel-Newton scheme to solve the resulting system of algebraic equations within each time-integration step. Additionally, we consider a specific treatment of the interpolation between different meshes within the partitioned approach. This is shown for p -version finite elements based on hierarchical shape functions. Finally, it turns out that the specific constitutive model of small-strain thermo-viscoplasticity, which is based on the decomposition into kinematic hardening and energy storing strains, yields a problem-adapted stress algorithm. This allows to reduce the stress algorithm on Gauss-point level to the solution of one scalar equation. Numerical examples serve to eluciyear the behavior and properties of the proposed methods.},

Within the frame of this article, we limit ourselves to the case of nonlinear thermoelasticity at finite strains, using temperature-dependent material parameters. For the thermal radiation field, diffuse radiating surfaces and gray participating media are assumed. Moreover, we present a robust and fast partitioned coupling strategy for the fourth field problem. Stability and efficiency of the implicit coupling algorithm are improved drawing on several methods to stabilize and to accelerate the convergence. To conclude and to review the effectiveness and the advantages of the additional thermal radiation field several numerical examples are considered to study the proposed algorithm.

Standard finite elements are used in the major part of the domain and enriched elements are employed where special solution properties such as discontinuities and singularities shall be captured. In elements that blend the enriched areas with the rest of the domain problems arise in general. These blending elements often require a special treatment in order to avoid a decrease in the overall convergence rate. A modification of the {XFEM} approximation is proposed in this work. The enrichment functions are modified such that they are zero in the standard elements, unchanged in the elements with all their nodes being enriched, and varying continuously in the blending elements. All nodes in the blending elements are enriched. The modified enrichment function can be reproduced exactly everywhere in the domain and no problems arise in the blending elements. The corrected {XFEM} is applied to problems in linear elasticity and optimal convergence rates are achieved. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The topics that are covered can be summarized as follows:—The computation of nonlinear equilibrium paths with continuation through limit points and bifurcation points.—The determination of critical equilibrium states.

Characteristic to the procedures employed is the use of the length of the equilibrium path as control parameter. This feature, together with the second order iteration method of Newton, offers a reliable basis for the procedures described. Actual computations, carried out on a finite element model of a shallow circular arch, illustrate the effectiveness of the methods proposed.},

Currently existing research more focuses on the first issue while the efficiency issue is not elaborated when the overall equations are solved at each refinement step. This article develops an approach to promote the efficiency by locally solving the equations that govern the refined variables at each refinement step. Here, hierarchical refinement of the state variables in {NURBS} is adopted and transformational matrix that transforms the basis functions from the current level to the refined level is utilized to handle the relations between the equations at different levels. By dividing the coefficient matrix into blocks and estimating the error of state variables for different blocks, we represent the global solution method in a hierarchical structure and separately construct and solve equations to obtain the solution for each level in the structure. We valiyear the proposed method by some steady heat-transfer and structural analysis problems in domains with different dimensionality. We have compared the numerical result accuracy as well as the time cost of the proposed method with those of current available refinement approaches, and it turns out to be very promising.},

To this end, a hierarchical error indicator is applied to automatically control the polynomial degree q in thickness and p in the in-plane direction of plate- and shell-like structures.

It is shown that an appropriate construction of the elements in the blending area, the region where the enriched elements blend to unenriched elements, is often crucial for good performance of local partition of unity enrichments. An enhanced strain formulation is developed which leads to good performance; the optimal rate of convergence is achieved. For polynomial enrichments, it is shown that a proper choice of the finite element shape functions and partition of unity shape functions also improves the accuracy and convergence. The methods are illustrated by several examples. The examples deal primarily with the signed distance function enrichment for treating discontinuous derivatives inside an element, but other enrichments are also considered. Results show that both methods provide optimal rates of convergence. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We find that increased smoothness, that is, the “k-method,” leads to a significant increase in accuracy for the problems of structural vibrations over the classical C 0 -continuous “p-method,” whereas a judicious insertion of C 0 -continuous surfaces about singularities in a mesh otherwise generated by the k-method, usually outperforms a mesh in which all basis functions attain their maximum level of smoothness. We conclude that the potential for the k-method is high, but smoothness is an issue that is not well understood due to the historical dominance of C 0 -continuous finite elements and therefore further studies are warranted.},

In order to compensate the additional numerical effort of the three-dimensional approach, an anisotropic p-adaptive method for linear elastodynamic problems is proposed, resulting in a clearly higher efficiency and higher convergence rates than uniform p-extensions. Special emphasis is placed on the accurate transfer of loads considering the fluid discretization for computation of the surface load integrals. For a coupling with a cartesian grid based Lattice Boltzmann code it was found that oscillations in the interface tractions may excite higher structural modes possibly leading to a nonstable coupling behavior. A first remedy to this problem was a linear modal analysis of the structure, thus allowing to control the number of modes to be considered without disregarding bidirectional fluid structure interactions. Preliminary results are presented for the {FSI} benchmark configuration proposed in this book.},

In the elements, which are intersected by the discontinuity, additional displacement degrees of freedom are introduced at the existing nodes. Therefore, two independent copies of the standard basis functions are used. One set is put to zero on one side of the discontinuity, while it takes its usual values on the opposite side, and vice versa for the other set. To model inelastic material behaviour, a discrete damage-type constitutive model is applied, formulated in terms of displacements and tractions at the surface. Some details on the numerical implementation are given, concerning the failure criterion, the determination of the direction of the discontinuity and the integration scheme. Finally, numerical examples show the performance of the method. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Cracks are treated by adding phantom nodes and superposing elements on the original mesh. Shear bands are treated by adding phantom degrees of freedom. The proposed method simplifies the treatment of element-by-element crack and shear band propagation in explicit methods. A quadrature method for 4-node quadrilaterals is proposed based on a single quadrature point and hourglass control. The proposed method provides consistent history variables because it does not use a subdomain integration scheme for the discontinuous integrand.

The task is to integrate either on the zero-level set or in the sub-domains defined by the sign of the level-set function. In three dimensions, this is either an integration on a surface or inside a volume. A starting point is the identification and meshing of the zero-level set by means of higher-order interface elements. For the volume integration, special sub-elements are proposed where the element faces coincide with the identified interface elements on the zero-level set. Standard Gauss points are mapped onto the interface elements or into the volumetric sub-elements. The resulting integration points may, for example, be used in fictitious domain methods and extended finite element methods. For the case of hexahedral meshes, parts of the approach may also be seen as a higher-order marching cubes algorithm. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The method constructs an approximation space consisting of mesh-based, enriched moving least-squares ({MLS}) functions near discontinuities and standard {FE} shape functions elsewhere. There is only one shape function per node, and these functions are able to represent known characteristics of the solution such as discontinuities, singularities, etc. The {MLS} method constructs shape functions based on an intrinsic basis by minimizing a weighted error functional. Thereby, weight functions are involved, and special mesh-based weight functions are proposed in this work. The enrichment is achieved through the intrinsic basis.

The investigations emphasize three sets of choices which lead to different contact algorithms that have distinct advantages and disadvantages. First, on the optimization side, both exterior and interior point methods are applied, thus spanning inexact constraint enforcement algorithms of the penalty or barrier type as well as exact ones of the primal–dual type. Second, on the discretization side, the hierarchical basis set of the mortar variables is inherited either directly from the discretization of the slave surface or after an intermediate normalization step to satisfy the partition of unity. Third, in interaction with both optimization and discretization, the kinematic mortar variable is recovered from the actual normal gap through the full or lumped solution of a linear system of equations. The implications of different choices are highlighted through benchmark problems which monitor the solution quality at the global level through the structural force evolution and at the local level through the contact pressure distribution.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an isogeometric formulation for rotation-free thin shell analysis of structures comprised of multiple patches. The structural patches are C1- or higher-order continuous in the interior, and are joined with C0-continuity. The Kirchhoff–Love shell theory that relies on higher-order continuity of the basis functions is employed in the patch interior as presented in Kiendl et al. [36]. For the treatment of patch boundaries, a method is developed in which strips of fictitious material with unidirectional bending stiffness and zero membrane stiffness are added at patch interfaces. The direction of bending stiffness is chosen to be transverse to the patch interface. This choice leads to an approximate satisfaction of the appropriate kinematic constraints at patch interfaces without introducing additional stiffness to the shell structure. The attractive features of the method include simplicity of implementation and direct applicability to complex, multi-patch shell structures. The good performance of the bending strip method is demonstrated on a set of benchmark examples. Application to a wind turbine rotor subjected to realistic wind loads is also shown. Extension of the bending strip approach to the coupling of solids and shells is proposed and demonstrated numerically.},

	abstract = {In the finite element method ({FEM}), a mesh is used for representing the geometry of the analysis and for representing the test and trial functions by piece-wise interpolation. Recently, analysis techniques that use structured grids have been developed to avoid the need for a conforming mesh. The boundaries of the analysis domain are represented using implicit equations while a structured grid is used to interpolate functions. Such a method for analysis using structured grids is presented here in which the analysis domain is constructed by Boolean combination of step functions. Implicit equations of the boundary are used in the construction of trial and test functions such that essential boundary conditions are guaranteed to be satisfied. Furthermore, these functions are constructed such that internal elements, through which no boundary passes, have the same stiffness matrix. This approach has been applied to solve linear elastostatic problems and the results are compared with analytical and finite element analysis solutions to show that the method gives solutions that are similar to the {FEM} in quality but is less computationally expensive for dense mesh/grid and avoids the need for a conforming mesh.

However, in contrast to the above mentioned paper, we do not introduce additional unknowns in the variational formulation to capture the displacement discontinuity. Instead, the crack is modeled by splitting particles located on opposite sides of the associated crack segments and we make use of the visibility method in order to describe the crack kinematics.

	abstract = {Abstract-The finite element method is nowadays the most general and one of the most powerful tools for the analysis of structures. It is also a general mathematical technique and the main concern of the paper is to present it in this light. Functional Analysis is used as the ideal frame for a general abstract formulation. The ability to predict convergence to the exact solution of a sequence af approximate solutions obtained from patterns of finite elements with decreasing size is fundamental in the application of the method. In case conformity between elements is obtained, the finite element method is a particular case of Ritz’s method, so that convergence can be ensured as far as completeness is achieved. A general completeness criterion is justified in the paper. Such criterion requires that the field components and all their derivatives, of order not higher than the highest order of derivative entering into the energy density expression, can take up any constant value within the element. It is finally proved that such criterion is also a general convergence criterion, i.e. a sufficient condition for convergence even if conformity is not achieved. {NOTATION} All the symbols will be defined where they are introduced.

A linear combination of the Lagrangian shape functions in these integration subelements are then used as the enrichment functions to capture the discontinuity in the gradient field. This approach provides a great flexibility for evaluating the enrichment functions, including for cases where elements are intersected with multiple interfaces. We show that the method achieves optimal rate of convergence with meshes which do not conform to the phase interfaces at a computational cost similar to or lower than that of conventional {GFEM}.

High-order methods are gaining prominence in several engineering and biomedical applications due to their improved accuracy over low-order techniques at reduced computational cost for a given number of degrees of freedom. However, their proliferation is often limited by their complexity, which makes these methods challenging to implement and use. Nektar++ is an initiative to overcome this limitation by encapsulating the mathematical complexities of the underlying method within an efficient C++ framework, making the techniques more accessible to the broader scientific and industrial communities. The software supports a variety of discretisation techniques and implementation strategies, supporting methods research as well as application-focused computation, and the multi-layered structure of the framework allows the user to embrace as much or as little of the complexity as they need. The libraries capture the mathematical constructs of spectral/ h p element methods, while the associated collection of pre-written {PDE} solvers provides out-of-the-box application-level functionality and a template for users who wish to develop solutions for addressing questions in their own scientific domains.

The enrichment function is then determined by solving numerically a nonlinear equation which determines the distance from any point to the spline curve. Parametric convergence studies are carried out to show the accuracy of this approach compared with pointwise and linear segmentation of points for the construction of the enrichment function in the case of simple inclusions and arbitrarily shaped inclusions in linear elasticity. Moreover, the viability of this approach is illustrated on a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material with a hole undergoing large deformation. In this case, the enrichment is able to adapt to the deformation and effectively capture the correct response without remeshing. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This article introduces a new algorithm for evaluating enrichment functions in the higher-order hierarchical interface-enriched finite element method ({HIFEM}), which enables the fully mesh-independent simulation of multiphase problems with intricate morphologies. The proposed hierarchical enrichment technique can accurately capture gradient discontinuities along materials interfaces that are in close proximity, in contact, and even intersecting with one another using nonconforming finite element meshes for discretizing the problem. We study different approaches for creating higher-order {HIFEM} enrichments corresponding to six-node triangular elements and analyze the advantages and shortcomings of each approach. The preferred method, which yields the lowest computational cost and highest accuracy, relies on a special mapping between the local and global coordinate systems for evaluating enrichment functions. A comprehensive convergence study is presented to show that this method yields similar convergence rate and precision as those of the standard {FEM} with conforming meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the higher-order {HIFEM} for simulating the thermal and deformation responses of several materials systems and engineering problems with complex geometries.

The presented method utilizes generalized degrees of freedom and enrichment functions based on {NURBS} to capture the solution with non-conforming meshes. A consistent method for the generation and application of the {NURBS}-based enrichment functions is introduced. These enrichment functions offer various advantages including simplicity of the integration, possibility of different modes of local solution refinement, and ease of implementation. In addition, we show that these functions well capture weak discontinuities associated with highly curved material interfaces. The convergence, accuracy, and stability of the method in the solution of two-dimensional elasto-static problems are compared with the standard finite element scheme, showing improved accuracy. Finally, the performance of the method for solving problems with complex internal geometry is highlighted through a numerical example. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

First, a review of the asymptotic analysis of Gui and Babuška [1] is given and is used to characterize the optimal hp meshes which are geometrically graded toward the singular point. The asymptotically optimal hp meshes are compared with the hp meshes which are constructed by employing the hp strategy of Rachowicz et al. [2], which employs the principle of maximum change of error per change in the number of degrees of freedom, and the true optimal hp meshes which minimize the error for fixed number of degrees of freedom and which are determined by searching through the entire sequence of the admissible hp meshes. It is shown that, for the singular solution, the meshes constructed by the hp strategy of Rachowicz coincide with the true optimal meshes; nevertheless, there exist various solutions for which the algorithm which employs the principle of maximum change of error may not converge. For this reason the hp strategy of Rachowicz is combined with the classical feedback algorithm to obtain a robust hp strategy which always converges. Further, it is shown that the asymptotically optimal hp meshes are very close to the true optimal hp meshes in the entire range of practical computation. The effect of the accuracy of the error estimator on the optimality of the constructed hp meshes is also analyzed. It is shown that unless the estimator is sufficiently accurate in the element adjacent to the singular point, the meshes constructed by the adaptive hp strategy can differ substantially from the true optimal meshes.},

Knowledge of lumbar spinal loads is required in proper management of various spinal disorders, effective risk prevention and assessment in the workplace, sports and rehabilitation, realistic testing of spinal implants as well as adequate loading in in vitro studies. During the last few decades, researchers have used a number of techniques to estimate spinal loads by measuring in vivo changes in the intradiscal pressure, body height, or forces and moments transmitted via instrumented vertebral implants. In parallel, computational models have been employed to estimate muscle forces and spinal loads under various static and dynamic conditions. Noteworthy is the increasing growth in latter computational investigations.

This paper aims to review, compare and critically evaluate the existing literature on in vivo measurements and computational model studies of lumbar spinal loads to lay the foundation for future biomechanical studies. Towards this goal, the paper reviews in separate sections models dealing with static postures (standing, sitting, lying) as well as slow and fast dynamic activities (lifting, sudden perturbations and vibrations). The findings are helpful in many areas such as work place safety design and ergonomics, injury prevention, performance enhancement, implant design and rehabilitation management.},

The method promises a complete solution, satisfying all of the requirements of a Ritz coordinate function. The influence of interior points on the domain solution is included in this construction. Similar to conformal bubble functions, the test functions are zero along the boundary and single valued only at the points they describe. Unlike the bubble function construction, the interior points can be located at any desired point in the domain. The resulting set of trial functions can satisfy the required global conditions including the exact reproduction of constant and linear fields. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The values of shape functions and their derivatives are therefore mapped from the master element, as in the conventional finite element method.

The approach is to employ the moving least-square ({MLS}) scheme to devise a class of elements with an arbitrary number of nodal points on the parental domain. This approach generally leads to elements with the rational shape functions, which significantly extends the function space of the conventional finite element method. With a special choice of the nodal points and the base functions, the method results in useful elements with the polynomial shape functions for which the C1 continuity breaks down across the boundaries between the subdomains comprising one element. The present scheme possesses an extremely high potential for applications which deal with various problems with discontinuities, such as material inhomogeneity, crack propagation, phase transition and contact mechanics. The effectiveness of the new elements for handling the discontinuities due to non-matching interfaces is demonstrated using appropriate examples. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show stability of the system on a slim domain discretized by a tensor product mesh, where the constant of stability does not depend on the aspect ratio of the discretization. We give interpolation operators for the finite element spaces, and thereby obtain optimal order a priori error estimates for the approximate solution.

	abstract = {A new hybrid pseudo-{CSG}/{BRep} schema for product modelling is described. In this schema, there exists a clear distinction between morphology and the geometry of an object. At the highest level of abstraction, the object morphology or shape is hierarchically defined by means of a graph, called Feature Adjacency Graph ({FAG}), in which the nodes are either positive or negative volumetric cells (form features) and the arcs are adjacency/interaction relationships between those cells. The hierarchical morphological characterization of an object made by the {FAG} allows to one decrease or even suppress the semantic gap between the product model and the underlying solid model since each cell always embodies a form feature. In this manner it becomes possible to capture the designer intent, as well as to help the {CAD}/{CAM} integration. At the low level of abstraction, i.e., the {BRep} level, two associated data structures are maintained. The first, called Feature Topological Structure ({FTS}), holds the family of volumetric cells, each one of them represented explicitly by its surface boundary ({BRep}). The second constitutes the evaluated {BRep} model itself for the object solid. It should be noted that any constructive or destructive compositional action in the object definition occurs simultaneously in both data structures. In a way, the {FTS} retains at a low level, the construction history of the object model. Besides, the availability of the topological entities belonging to the {BRep} allows a graphical dialog with the model and also facilitates the generation of instructions for {NC} milling machines. In short, this hybrid pseudo-{CSG}/{BRep} intends to capture the virtues of both representation schemas and eliminate as much as possible as their underlying drawbacks.},

Modeling buildings in fully parametric 3D computer-aided design ({CAD}) systems offers numerous benefits in terms of productivity, the ability to rapidly generate design alternatives at different levels and elimination of errors that result from the disparity between different drawings in current practice. However, full realization of these benefits requires specialized functionality, including top-down modeling, objects with functional behavior, the ability to embed contextual design intent, automation of layout and detailing and appropriate management of similar objects. An effective system must provide such functionality while maintaining adequate response times. The requirements, features and performance have been examined as part of specification of a new 3D parametric {CAD} platform for the North American Precast Concrete Software Consortium ({PCSC}).

	abstract = {Recently developed solid modelling systems for the design of complex physical solids using interactive computer graphics offer the exciting possibility of an integrated design/analysis system. Called geometric modellers, these systems build complex solids from primitive solids (cubes, cylinders, spheres, solid patches, etc.) and macro solids (combination of primitives)3, 4, 8, 16, 18, 25, 38. To provide an effective structural analysis capability for these systems, methods must be devised to ease the burden of discretizing the solid geometry into a user controlled (usually locally graded) finite element mesh. The purpose of this paper is to describe an interactive solid mesh generation system capable of generating valid meshes of well-proportional tetrahedral finite elements for the decomposition of multiply connected solid structures. The system uses a semi-automatic node insertion procedure to locate element node points within and on the surface of a structure. An independent automatic three-dimensional triangulator then accepts these nodes as input and connects them to form a valid finite element mesh oftetrahedral elements. Although this report makes use of a modeller based on a constructive solid geometry representation (a so-called {CSG} modeller), the mesh generation strategy elaborated herein is completely general and makes no particular use of the {CSG} representation.},

	shorttitle = {Osteoporosis imaging},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength due to a reduction of bone mass and deterioration of bone microstructure predisposing an individual to an increased risk of fracture. Trabecular bone microstructure analysis and finite element models ({FEM}) have shown to improve the prediction of bone strength beyond bone mineral density ({BMD}) measurements. These computational methods have been developed and valiyeard in specimens preserved in formalin solution or by freezing. However, little is known about the effects of preservation on trabecular bone microstructure and {FEM}. The purpose of this observational study was to investigate the effects of preservation on trabecular bone microstructure and {FEM} in human vertebrae.
{METHODS}: Four thoracic vertebrae were harvested from each of three fresh human cadavers (n=12). Multi-detector computed tomography ({MDCT}) images were obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 month follow-up. In the intervals between {MDCT} imaging, two vertebrae from each donor were formalin-fixed and frozen, respectively. {BMD}, trabecular bone microstructure parameters (histomorphometry and fractal dimension), and {FEM}-based apparent compressive modulus ({ACM}) were determined in the {MDCT} images and valiyeard by mechanical testing to failure of the vertebrae after 6 months.
{RESULTS}: Changes of {BMD}, trabecular bone microstructure parameters, and {FEM}-based {ACM} in formalin-fixed and frozen vertebrae over 6 months ranged between 1.0-5.6\% and 1.3-6.1\%, respectively, and were not statistically significant (p{\textgreater}0.05). {BMD}, trabecular bone microstructure parameters, and {FEM}-based {ACM} as assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 month follow-up correlated significantly with mechanically determined failure load (r=0.89-0.99; p{\textless}0.05). The correlation coefficients r were not significantly different for the two preservation methods (p{\textgreater}0.05).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Formalin fixation and freezing up to six months showed no significant effects on trabecular bone microstructure and {FEM}-based {ACM} in human vertebrae and may both be used in corresponding in-vitro experiments in the context of osteoporosis.},

	abstract = {The (Isogeometric) Finite Cell Method - in which a domain is immersed in a structured background mesh - suffers from conditioning problems when cells with small volume fractions occur. In this contribution, we establish a rigorous scaling relation between the condition number of (I){FCM} system matrices and the smallest cell volume fraction. Ill-conditioning stems either from basis functions being small on cells with small volume fractions, or from basis functions being nearly linearly dependent on such cells. Based on these two sources of ill-conditioning, an algebraic preconditioning technique is developed, which is referred to as Symmetric Incomplete Permuted Inverse Cholesky ({SIPIC}). A detailed numerical investigation of the effectivity of the {SIPIC} preconditioner in improving (I){FCM} condition numbers and in improving the convergence speed and accuracy of iterative solvers is presented for the Poisson problem and for two- and three-dimensional problems in linear elasticity, in which Nitche's method is applied in either the normal or tangential direction. The accuracy of the preconditioned iterative solver enables mesh convergence studies of the finite cell method.},

	abstract = {The extended finite element method (X-{FEM}) has proven to be an accurate, robust method for solving embedded interface problems. With a few exceptions, the X-{FEM} has mostly been used in conjunction with piecewise-linear shape functions and an associated piecewise-linear geometrical representation of interfaces. In the current work, the use of spline-based finite elements is examined along with a Nitsche technique for enforcing constraints on an embedded interface. To obtain optimal rates of convergence, we employ a hierarchical local refinement approach to improve the geometrical representation of curved interfaces. We further propose a novel weighting for the interfacial consistency terms arising in the Nitsche variational form with B-splines. A qualitative dependence between the weights and the stabilization parameters is established with additional element level eigenvalue calculations. An important consequence of this weighting is that the bulk as well as the interfacial fields remain well behaved in the presence of large heterogeneities as well as elements with arbitrarily small volume fractions. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method through several numerical examples. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A systematic design approach has been developed for thermal processes combining the finite element method, design sensitivity analysis and optimization. Conductive heat transfer is solved in an Eulerian formulation, where the heat flux is fixed in space and the material flows through a control volume. For constant velocity and heat flux distribution, the Eulerian formulation reduces to a steady-state problem, whereas the Lagrangian formulation remains transient. The reduction to a steady-state problem drastically improves the computational efficiency. Streamline Upwinding Petrov–Galerkin stabilization is employed to suppress the spurious oscillations. Design sensitivities of the temperature field are computed using both the direct differentiation and the adjoint methods. The systematic approach is applied in optimizing the laser surfacing process, where a moving laser beam heats the surface of a plate, and hardening is achieved by rapid cooling due to the heat transfer below the surface. The optimization objective is to maximize the rate of surface hardening. Constraints are introduced on the computed temperature and temperature rate fields to ensure that phase transformations are activated and that melting does not occur.

The proposed formulation can handle arbitrary orientations of the cross section along the beam.

In this publication, {NURBS} are used as basis functions for discretization, since they can easily provide the required C 1 -continuity between elements. The presented element formulation has four degrees of freedom, three for displacements and one for the rotation around the center line.

The common feature with other immersed methods is that the current approach substantially reduces the burden of mesh generation. In contrast, the exact boundary representation of the embedded domain allows to overcome the major drawback of existing immersed methods that is the inaccurate representation of the physical domain. A novel approach to perform the numerical integration in the region of the cut elements that is internal to the physical domain is presented and its accuracy and performance evaluated using numerical tests. The applicability, performance, and optimal convergence of the proposed methodology is assessed by using numerical examples in three dimensions. It is also shown that the accuracy of the proposed methodology is independent on the {CAD} technology used to describe the geometry of the embedded domain. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The mechanical response of patient-specific bone to various load conditions is of major clinical importance in orthopedics. Herein we enhance the methods presented in Yosibash et al. [2007. A {CT}-based high-order finite element analysis of the human proximal femur compared to in-vitro experiments. {ASME} Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 129(3), 297-309.] for the reliable simulations of the human proximal femur by high-order finite elements ({FEs}) and valiyear the simulations by experimental observations.
{METHOD} {OF} {APPROACH}: A fresh-frozen human femur was scanned by quantitative computed tomography ({QCT}) and thereafter loaded (in vitro experiments) by a quasi-static force of up to 1250 N. {QCT} scans were manipulated to generate a high-order {FE} bone model with distinct cortical and trabecular regions having inhomogeneous isotropic elastic properties with Young's modulus represented by continuous spatial functions. Sensitivity analyses were performed to quantify parameters that mostly influence the mechanical response. {FE} results were compared to displacements and strains measured in the experiments.
{RESULTS}: Young moduli correlated to {QCT} Hounsfield Units by relations in Keyak and Falkinstein [2003. Comparison of in situ and in vitro {CT} scan-based finite element model predictions of proximal femoral fracture load. Medical Engineering and Physics 25, 781-787.] were found to provide predictions that match the experimental results closely. Excellent agreement was found for both the displacements and strains. The presented study demonstrates that reliable and valiyeard high-order patient-specific {FE} simulations of human femurs based on {QCT} data are achievable for clinical computer-aided decision making.},

The rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of rise, {VA}, of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring Na currents during periodic impulses in the voltage clamp. 2. {VA} measurements showed that in alkaline solutions ({pH} up to 8-8) the offset rate was unchanged while the onset was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active cationic form of tetrodotoxin. 3. Both {VA} measurements and those in the voltage clamp revealed a decrease in T'off, the offset time constant and in increase in the onset time constant, T'on, as the {pH} was lowered. 4. For tetrodotoxin concentrations, [{TTX}], up to 400 {nM} and {pH} values down to 5-3 the simple relation T'on/T'off = p'R held, where p'T is the constant factor by which the Na permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given [{TTX}]. 5. The agreement between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when, at constant [{TTX}] and {pH}. p'T was modified by the holding potential during equilibration. 6. No unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features resemble acid catalysis.},

Because the element shape functions are polynomials, the stiffness matrix is computed precisely with standard Gauss quadrature rules. Several numerical examples of linear elasticity are presented to valiyear the accuracy and convergence of the proposed elements. One of the advantages of the proposed elements is that they can be used as transition elements with hanging nodes on higher-order approximation meshes. Building on this advantage, h- and hp-adaptive finite element analyses of numerical examples with local singularities are performed on triangular quadtree meshes in order to demonstrate the performance of the adaptive strategies using the proposed elements.},

We show that the p-version of our {GFEM} is capable of achieving very high accuracy for multiscale problems which may be impossible to solve using the standard {FEM}. We analyse the effect of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the method namely: (a) The data and the buffer included in the handbook domains, and (b) The accuracy of the numerical construction of the handbook functions. We illustrate the robustness of the method by employing as model problem the Laplacian in a domain with a large number of closely spaced voids. Similar robustness can be expected for problems of heat-conduction and elasticity set in domains with a large number of closely spaced voids, cracks, inclusions, etc. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	shorttitle = {Mathematical relationships between bone density and mechanical properties},
	abstract = {Background
In many published studies, elastic properties of bone are correlated to the bone density, in order to derive an empirical elasticity–density relationship. The most common use of these relationships is the prediction of the bone local properties from medical imaging data in subject-specific numerical simulation studies. The proposed relationships are substantially different one from the other. It is unclear whether such differences in elasticity–density relationships can be entirely explained in terms of methodological discrepancies among studies.
Methods
All relevant literature was reviewed. Only elasticity–density relationships derived from similarly controlled experiments were included and properly normalized. The resulting relationships were grouped according to the most important methodological differences: type of end support during testing, specimen geometry, and anatomical sampling location.
Findings
Even after normalization with respect to strain rate and densitometric measurement unit, substantial inter-study differences do exist, and they can only be partially explained by the methodological differences between studies.
Interpretation
Some recommendations are made for the application of elasticity–density relationships to subject-specific finite element studies. The importance of defining a standardized mechanical testing methodology for bone specimens is stressed, and some guidelines that emerged from the literature are proposed. To identify density–elasticity relationships suitable for use in subject-specific {FE} studies, the development of a benchmark study is also proposed, where the elasticity–density relationship is taken as the variable under study, and a numerical model of known numerical accuracy predicts experimental strain measurements.},

It is shown that the idea of finite element models can be developed in higher-dimensional spaces, independent of specific co-ordinate systems, for any type of continuous abstract function defined on the space. Generalizations of the familiar Lagrange and Hermite interpolation functions are presented as well as a general statement of the notion of generalized variables and conjugate fields. It is also shown that admissible finite elements can be developed for non-Euclidean spaces of finite dimension. Topological properties of finite element models are examined in Part I of the paper.

	abstract = {Spectral methods have long been popular in direct and large eddy simulation of turbulent flows, but their use in areas with complex-geometry computational domains has historically been much more limited. More recently the need to find accurate solutions to the viscous flow equations around complex configurations has led to the development of high-order discretisation procedures on unstructured meshes, which are also recognised as more efficient for solution of time-dependent oscillatory solutions over long time periods. Here Karniadakis and Sherwin present a much-upyeard and expanded version of their successful first edition covering the recent and significant progress in multi-domain spectral methods at both the fundamental and application level. Containing over 50\% new material, including discontinuous Galerkin methods, non-tensorial nodal spectral element methods in simplex domains, and stabilisation and filtering techniques, this text aims to introduce a wider audience to the use of spectral/hp element methods with particular emphasis on their application to unstructured meshes. It provides a detailed explanation of the key concepts underlying the methods along with practical examples of their derivation and application, and is aimed at students, academics and practitioners in computational fluid mechanics, applied and numerical mathematics, computational mechanics, aerospace and mechanical engineering and climate/ocean modelling.},

It combines the computational advantages of B-splines and standard mesh-based elements. In particular, degree and smoothness can be chosen arbitrarily without substantially increasing the dimension. Hence, accurate approximations are obtained with relatively few parameters. Moreover, the regular grid is well suited for hierarchical refinement and multigrid techniques. This article should serve as an introduction to finite element approximation with B-splines. We first review the construction of Web-bases and discuss their basic properties. Then we illustrate the performance of Ritz–Galerkin schemes for a model problem and applications in linear elasticity. Finally, we discuss several implementation aspects.},

For the three-field Stokes problem describing linearized non-Newtonian flow, we estimate discrete inf—sup constants explicit in both h and k for various subspace choices (continuous and discontinuous) for the extra-stress. We also give a stability analysis of the hp-version of an elastic-viscous-split-stress ({EVSS}) method and present elements that are stable and optimal in h and k.

	abstract = {A high-order generalized finite element method ({GFEM}) for non-planar three-dimensional crack surfaces is presented. Discontinuous p-hierarchical enrichment functions are applied to strongly graded tetrahedral meshes automatically created around crack fronts. The {GFEM} is able to model a crack arbitrarily located within a finite element ({FE}) mesh and thus the proposed method allows fully automated fracture analysis using an existing {FE} discretization without cracks. We also propose a crack surface representation that is independent of the underlying {GFEM} discretization and controlled only by the physics of the problem. The representation preserves continuity of the crack surface while being able to represent non-planar, non-smooth, crack surfaces inside of elements of any size. The proposed representation also provides support for the implementation of accurate, robust, and computationally efficient numerical integration of the weak form over elements cut by the crack surface. Numerical simulations using the proposed {GFEM} show high convergence rates of extracted stress intensity factors along non-planar curved crack fronts and the robustness of the method.

To this end, we propose a numerical approach suitable for integrating broken elements with a low number of integration points. In this method, which is based on the moment fitting approach, an individual quadrature rule is set up for each cut element. The approach requires a B-rep representation of the broken element, which can be either achieved by processing a triangulated surface obtained from a {CAD} software or by taking advantage of a voxel model resulting from computed tomography. The numerical examples presented in this paper reveal that the proposed method delivers for a wide variety of geometrical situations very accurate results and requires a rather low number of integration points.},

Generalised plane strain elements and interface elements have been developed for this purpose. The material behaviour is assumed to be governed by a mode I crack model including strain softening. In this paper a formulation is proposed for strain loading in non-linear analysis under arc length control. In addition, the constitutive model and the finite element formulation for the interface elements are discussed. Mesh objectivity and the influence of fracture energy on delamination growth and laminate strength are examined in the analyses of [+25n/-25n/90n/]S laminates. Results show that the presented approach does not suffer from mesh dependency, which implies that size effects can be described properly.},

	abstract = {We present an isogeometric enrichment technique for three-dimensional finite element computations applied to frictional contact and mixed-mode debonding. This is an extension of previous work that focused on two-dimensional and frictionless problems. To offer a more complete view of the enriched element’s performance, a comparison of the results to tri-variate isogeometric discretizations and standard Lagrangian elements is also included here. The enrichment is applied by discretizing parts of the surface that require higher accuracy with isogeometric basis functions, while the rest of the body uses Lagrangian shape functions. By using an isogeometric surface representation, the higher continuity across element boundaries and higher order of interpolation can be exploited. At the same time, the generation of tri-variate isogeometric meshes is avoided.

A convergence study without any surface effects, involving only volume integrals, shows that the enriched elements can also be beneficial for these problems. The major advantage of the isogeometric element enrichment over standard tri-linear elements is demonstrated in contact problems including normal and tangential tractions. For both, mixed-mode cohesive debonding and frictional contact, the enrichment increases robustness and leads to more accurate results than standard linear Lagrangian elements. All computations are also compared to results using tri-variate isogeometric discretizations to give a complete picture of the element’s performance. It is also shown that the proposed enrichment formulation has advantages in mesh generation.},

These parametric solutions are precomputed off-line and stored in memory in the form of a computational vademecum so that they can be used on-line with negligible cost. This renders a more efficient computational method than traditional finite element methods at performing simulations of processes. One key issue of the proposed method is the efficient computation of the parametric enrichments. These are computed and efficiently stored in memory by employing proper generalized decompositions. Although the presented method can be broadly applied, it is particularly well suited in manufacturing processes involving localized physics that depend on many parameters, such as welding. After introducing the vademecum-generalized finite element method formulation, we present some numerical examples related to the simulation of thermal models encountered in welding processes.

Um eine statische Analyse durchzuführen, soll ein Tragwerk nicht mehr in dimensionsreduzierte Strukturen, wie Balken, Platten oder Stabwerke eingeteilt werden. Es soll stattdessen für alle Aufgaben ein einheitlich volumenorientierter Ansatz basierend auf finiten Elementen hoher Ordnung zum Einsatz kommen. Ziel der Arbeit ist, dieses Modell zu beschreiben, sich daraus ergebende Fragen zu diskutieren und Lösungsmöglichkeiten aufzuzeigen. Ein besonderes Augenmerk liegt auf der Frage, inwieweit sich volumenorientierte Berechnungsergebnisse zur Bemessung von Stahlbetonbauteilen nutzen lassen und welche Vorteile sich daraus ergeben.},

This task is important in computational mechanics applications where internal interfaces are present in the computational domain. The proposed method creates boundary-conforming integration subcells for composed numerical quadrature, even in the presence of sharp geometric features (e.g. edges or vertices). Similar to the octree procedure, the algorithm subdivides the cut elements into eight octants. However, the octant nodes are moved onto the interface, which allows for a robust resolution of the intersection topology in the element while maintaining algorithmic simplicity. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method is able to deliver highly accurate domain integrals with a minimal number of quadrature points. Further examples show that the proposed method provides a viable alternative to standard octree-based approaches when combined with the Finite Cell Method.},

The approach has similarity to the residual method but differs from it in the use of norms of negative Sobolev spaces corresponding to the given bilinear (energy) form. For clarity the presentation is restricted to one-dimensional model problems. More specifically, the source, eigenvalue, and parabolic problems are considered involving a linear, self-adjoint operator of the second order. Generalizations to more general one-dimensional problems are straightforward, and the results also extend to higher space dimensions; but this involves some additional considerations. The estimates can be used for a practical a-posteriori assessment of the accuracy of a computed finite element solution, and they provide a basis for the design of adaptive finite element solvers.},

It is based on a general formulation of the finite element method in terms of certain bilinear forms on suitable Hilbert spaces. The main theorem gives an error estimate in terms of localized quantities which can be computed approximately. The estimate is optimal in the sense that, up to multiplicative constants which are independent of the mesh and solution, the upper and lower error bounds are the same. The theoretical results also lead to a heuristic characterization of optimal meshes, which in turn suggests a strategy for adaptive mesh refinement.

finite element methods for studying transient two-dimensional flow
problems in regions with moving boundaries. Attention is constrained to
the degree 'p' of the local polynomial shape functions which must be
increased to enhance the accuracy of the calculations while the mesh
size remains constant. The technique involves 'a posteriori' error
estimates for each element after each time-step. Local error indicators
are then obtained for comparisons with an indicator for the mesh as a
whole. A threshold value is selected which, when exceeded by the error
indicator, causes the local p-value to be increased. Consistent p-values
below the threshold result in lowering of the p-value, thus saving
computational effort. The moving boundary condition is addressed by
defining bounds within which the boundary conditions change. Several
heat conduction problems are calculated to illustrate the applications
of the model.},

It is shown that, by solving appropriate local residual type problems, one can obtain upper bounds on the error in the energy norm. Moreover, in the special case of adaptiveh-p finite element analysis, the estimator will also give a realistic estimate of the error. A key feature of this is the development of a systematic approach to the determination of boundary conditions for the local problems. The work extends and combines several existing methods to the case of fullh-p finite element approximation on possibly irregular meshes with, elements of non-uniform degree. As a special case, the analysis proves a conjecture made by Bank and Weiser [Some A Posteriori Error Estimators for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations, Math. Comput.44, 283–301 (1985)].},

Basically, error indicators are evaluated on the individual elements, and from these an estimate of the error in the energy norm is composed. Up to now this theory of a posteriori estimates has been developed only for linear problems. Here it is indicated how the results can be extended to the nonlinear case without losing their effectivity. The error indicators also allow for a very effective approach to an adaptive design of finite element meshes that are (nearly) optimal in a certain sense. Finally, we outline the design of an experimental finite element system now under development which incorporates many of these ideas and results. Its principal goal is to produce (near) optimal finite element solutions within a prescribed cost range.},

	abstract = {The finite cell method ({FCM}) is an immersed domain finite element method that combines higher-order non-boundary-fitted meshes, weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions, and adaptive quadrature based on recursive subdivision. Because of its ability to improve the geometric resolution of intersected elements, it can be characterized as an immersogeometric method. In this paper, we extend the {FCM}, so far only used with Cartesian hexahedral elements, to higher-order non-boundary-fitted tetrahedral meshes, based on a reformulation of the octree-based subdivision algorithm for tetrahedral elements. We show that the resulting {TetFCM} scheme is fully accurate in an immersogeometric sense, that is, the solution fields achieve optimal and exponential rates of convergence for h-refinement and p-refinement, if the immersed geometry is resolved with sufficient accuracy. {TetFCM} can leverage the natural ability of tetrahedral elements for local mesh refinement in three dimensions. Its suitability for problems with sharp gradients and highly localized features is illustrated by the immersogeometric phase-field fracture analysis of a human femur bone.

	shorttitle = {Patient-specific fracture risk assessment of vertebrae},
	abstract = {While in clinical settings, bone mineral density ({BMD}) measured by Computed Tomography, remains the key indicator for bone fracture risk, there is an ongoing quest for more engineering mechanics-based approaches for safety analyses of the skeleton. This calls for determination of suitable material properties from respective {CT}-data, where the traditional approach consists of regression analyses between attenuation-related grey values and mechanical properties. We here present a physics-oriented approach, considering that elasticity and strength of bone tissue originate from the material microstructure and the mechanical properties of its elementary components. Firstly, we re-construct the linear relation between the clinically accessible grey values making up a Computed Tomograph, and the X-ray attenuation coefficients quantifying the intensity losses from which the image is actually reconstructed. Therefore, we combine X-ray attenuation averaging at different length scales and over different tissues, with recently identified "universal" composition characteristics of the latter. This gives access to both the normally non-disclosed X-ray energy employed in the {CT}-device, and to in vivo, patient- and location-specific bone composition variables, such as voxel-specific mass density, as well as collagen and mineral contents. The latter feed an experimentally valiyeard multiscale elastoplastic model, based on the hierarchical organization of bone. Corresponding elasticity maps across the organ enter a Finite Element simulation of a typical load case, and the resulting stress states are increased in a proportional fashion, so as to check the safety against ultimate material failure. In the young patient investigated, even normal physiological loading is probable to already imply plastic events associated with the hydrated mineral crystals in the bone ultrastructure, while the safety factor against failure is still as high as five.

The original motivation was H 2 ⊄ C 0(Ω) for higher dimensions n ≥ 4 and hence nodal interpolation is not well defined. Todays main use of the approximation operators is for a reliability proof in a posteriori error control. The survey reports on the class of Clément type interpolation operators, its use in a posteriori finite element error control and for coarsening in adaptive mesh design.},

A micromechanics-based multiscale homogenization scheme proposed by Reisinger et al. is used to obtain the effective elastic properties of lamellar bone. The dissipative process in bone is modeled as viscoplastic deformation coupled to damage. The model is based on an orthotropic ecuntric elliptical criterion in stress space. In order to simplify material identification, an eccentric elliptical isotropic yield surface was defined in strain space, which is transformed to a stress-based criterion by means of the damaged compliance tensor. Viscoplasticity is implemented by means of the continuous Perzyna formulation. Damage is modeled by a scalar function of the accumulated plastic strain D(κ)D(κ)\{D({\textbackslash}kappa)\} , reducing all element s of the stiffness matrix. A polynomial flow rule is proposed in order to capture the rate-dependent post-yield behavior of lamellar bone. A numerical algorithm to perform the back projection on the rate-dependent yield surface has been developed and implemented in the commercial finite element solver Abaqus/Standard as a user subroutine {UMAT}. A consistent tangent operator has been derived and implemented in order to ensure quadratic convergence. Correct implementation of the algorithm, convergence, and accuracy of the tangent operator was tested by means of strain- and stress-based single element tests. A finite element simulation of nano- indentation in lamellar bone was finally performed in order to show the abilities of the newly developed constitutive model.},

	abstract = {Bone strength is a fundamental contributor to fracture risk, and with the recent development of in vivo 3D bone micro-architecture measurements by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, the finite element ({FE}) analysis may provide a means to assess patient bone strength in the distal radius. The purpose of this study was to determine an appropriate {FE} procedure to estimate bone strength by comparison with experimental data. Models based on a homogeneous tissue modulus or a modulus scaled according to computed tomography attenuation were assessed, and these were solved by linear and non-linear {FE} analyses to estimate strength. The distal radius from fresh, human cadaver forearms (5 male/5 female, ages 55 to 93) was dissected free and four 9.1 mm sections were cut beginning at the subchondral plate to provide 40 test specimens. The sections were scanned using an in vivo protocol providing 3D image data with an 82 microm voxel size. All specimens were mechanically tested in uniaxial compression, and elastic and yield properties were determined. Linear {FE} analyses were performed on all specimens (N=40), and non-linear analyses using an asymmetric, bilinear yield strain criteria were performed on a sub-sample (N=10) corresponding to the normal clinical measurement site. Experimentally determined apparent elastic properties correlated highly with ultimate stress (R2=0.977, p{\textless}0.05, N=31) for the 31 specimens tested to failure. Subsequently, a linear {FE} analysis estimating apparent elastic properties also correlated highly with failure, and the correlation was higher when moduli were determined from scaled {CT}-attenuation values than a homogeneous modulus (R2=0.983 vs. R2=0.972, p{\textless}0.05, N=31). A non-linear analysis based on tensile and compressive yield strains of 0.0295 and 0.0493 for homogeneous models, and 0.0127 and 0.0212 for scaled models directly estimated ultimate stress, and correlated highly (R2=0.951 vs. R2=0.937, p{\textless}0.05, N=5). The linear relation between stiffness and strength may be unique to radius compressive loading. It supports the use of a linear {FE} analysis to determine bone strength by regression equations established here. Scaled tissue modulus models performed better than homogeneous modulus models, and the advantage of a scaled model is its potential to account for mineralization changes. The combined numerical-experimental procedure for {FE} model validation on the patient micro-{CT} technology demonstrated that bone strength can be estimated non-invasively, and this may provide important insight into fracture risk in patient populations.},

A mathematical derivation of a posteriori estimates for the error and the error reduction corresponding to an h - or p -refinement of elements is presented. The estimation of the error reduction uses the solution of local problems, the estimate is bounded by the true reduction from below and above with constants only depending on the differential operator. Based on these a posteriori estimates an adaptive algorithm is derived. Numerical results show the efficiency of the estimators for several problem classes.

	abstract = {Adaptive refinement usually involves refining or enriching a fraction of mesh elements by one level based on a cut-off criterion, requiring several costly intermediate solutions before a mesh that yields an acceptable solution is obtained. We avoid this by formulating and solving the mesh design problem as a mathematical program. Our approach simultaneously modifies both mesh size (h) and local polynomial order (p) to yield an “optimal” mesh for a target error or given computational cost with gradients from local convergence rates. Constraints such as the one irregularity rule during mesh refinement are systematically incorporated in this formulation. The design task leads to a mixed integer nonlinear program ({MINLP}), that is relaxed to an {NLP}. To reduce the computations for the {NLP}, we employ simplified analytical gradients derived from initial mesh calculations. Finally, we apply our method to three model problems showing that complex hp-adaptive grids can be obtained directly from a uniform coarse grid.

Steering relies on a running simulation which delivers results to a visualization system. However, many simulation codes cannot deliver the required interactive results. For the first time, this work investigates the use of surrogate models to augment computational steering approaches. Based on the sparse grid method, we present a distributed system that is able to deliver approximate simulation snapshots from a central repository, at interactive rates, even for very large data sets. Combined with visual analytics derived from inherent surrogate model properties, we created a novel integrated workflow for the fast investigation of parametrized simulations.

Traditionally, the polynomial is subdivided until a root can be isolated. In contrast, herein we aim to find a root only to subdivide the polynomial at the root. This subdivision based algorithm exploits the property that the Bézier curves interpolate the end-points of their control polygons. Upon subdivision at the root, both resulting curves contain the root at one of their end-points, and hence contain a vanishing coefficient that is factored out. The algorithm then recurses on the new sub-curves, now of lower degree, yielding a computational efficiency. In addition, the proposed algorithm has the ability to efficiently count the multiplicities of the roots. Comparison of running times against the state-of-the-art on thousands of polynomials shows an improvement of about an order-of-magnitude.},

These results include the order of stress singularities at the free edge of an interface between adjacent layers in a laminated composite, as well as the case of an interface crack in a composite laminate.

	abstract = {Many elliptic partial differential equations can be solved numerically with near optimal efficiency through the uses of adaptive refinement and multigrid solution techniques. This paper presents a more unified approach to the combined process of adaptive refinement and multigrid solution which can be used with high order finite elements. Refinement is achieved by the bisection of pairs of triangles, corresponding to the addition of one or more basis functions to the approximation space. An approximation of the resulting change in the solution is used as an error indicator. The multigrid iteration uses red-black Gauss-Seidel relaxation with local black relaxations. The grid transfers use the change between the nodal and hierarchical bases. This multigrid iteration requires only \$O(N)\$ operations, even for highly nonuniform grids, and is defined for any finite element space. The full multigrid method is an optimal blending of the processes of adaptive refinement and multigrid iteration. To minimize the number of operations required, the duration of the refinement phase is based on increasing the dimension of the approximation space by the largest possible factor, given the error reduction of the multigrid iteration. The algorithm (i) uses only \$O(N)\$ operations, (ii) solves the discrete system to the accuracy of the discretization error, and (iii) achieves optimal convergence of the discretization error in the presence of singularities. Numerical experiments confirm this for linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.},

We show that the condition number of such a stiffness matrix behaves like O((log κ)2) where κ is the condition number of the stiffness matrix with respect to a nodal basis. In the case of a triangulation with uniform mesh sizeh this means that the stiffness matrix with respect to a hierarchical basis of the finite element space has a condition number behaving {likeO}((log1h)2)O((log⁡1h)2)O{\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{h\}\} {\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}2 \} {\textbackslash}right) instead {ofO}((1h)2)O((1h)2)O{\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{h\}\} {\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}2 \} {\textbackslash}right) for a nodal basis. The proofs of our theorems do not need any regularity properties of neither the continuous problem nor its discretization. Especially we do not need the quasiuniformity of the employed triangulations. As the representation of a finite element function with respect to a hierarchical basis can be converted very easily and quickly to its representation with respect to a nodal basis, our results mean that the method of conjugate gradients needs {onlyO}(log n) steps {andO}(n log n) computer operations to reduce the energy norm of the error by a given factor if one uses hierarchical bases or related preconditioning procedures.

	abstract = {In finite element simulation of sheet metal forming, shell elements are widely used. The limits of applicability of the shell elements are sometimes disregarded, which leads to an error in predictions of important values such as springback geometry. The underlying kinematic assumptions of the shell elements do not hold where the thickness of the metal sheet approaches the value of the radius of curvature. Complex three-dimensional material behavior effects cannot be represented precisely as the result of the simplified kinematics. Here we present a model adaptivity scheme based on a model error indicator. The model-adaptive technique presented in this paper aides to resolve only the critical areas of the structure with a three-dimensional discretization while keeping reasonable computational cost by utilizing shell elements for the rest of the structure. The model error indicator serves as a guide for subsequent automatic adaptive re-meshing of the work-piece followed by a model-adaptive finite element analysis. The accuracy of the approximation obtained by the model-adaptive technique coincides well with that of a more expensive solution obtained with solid elements only.},

In this paper, we use the extended finite element method (X-{FEM}) to solve scales involving complex geometries. The X-{FEM} allows one to use meshes not necessarily matching the physical surface of the problem while retaining the accuracy of the classical finite element approach. For material interfaces, this is achieved by introducing a new enrichment strategy. Although the mesh does not need to conform to the physical surfaces, it needs to be fine enough to capture the geometry of these surfaces. A simple algorithm is described to adaptively refine the mesh to meet this geometrical requirement. Numerical experiments on the periodic homogenization of two-phase complex cells demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of the X-{FEM}.},

The method enables the mesh-independent simulation of multiphase problems with materials interfaces that are in close proximity or contact while providing a straightforward general approach for evaluating the enrichments. In this manuscript, we present a detailed discussion on the implementation issues and required computational geometry considerations associated with the {HIFEM} approximation of thermal and mechanical responses of 3D problems.

However, their reduced kinematics is not sufficient to represent complex three-dimensional stress states. Solid finite elements provide a better approximation, yet at a significantly higher computational cost. This thesis presents a computational framework, in which the benefits of both element classes are combined  using solid elements only locally where the shell elements are insufficiently precise. The rest of the computational domain is discretized using shell elements. A mechanically motivated model error indicator is introduced to adaptively select appropriate elements. Results of these computations show very good agreement with the purely solid discretization, however, at a significantly lower computational cost.},

This approach is also applicable to arbitrary meshes.

The method utilizes simple structured meshes of hexahedral elements that do not necessarily conform to the material interfaces in heterogeneous materials. By avoiding the creation of conforming meshes used in conventional {FEM}, the {NIGFEM} leads to significant simplification of the mesh generation process. To achieve an accurate solution in elements that are crossed by material interfaces, the {NIGFEM} utilizes Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines ({NURBS}) to enrich the solution field locally. The accuracy and convergence of the {NIGFEM} are tested by solving a benchmark problem. We observe that the {NIGFEM} preserves an optimal rate of convergence, and provides additional advantages including the accurate capture of the solution fields in the vicinity of material interfaces and the built-in capability for hierarchical mesh refinement.

	abstract = {Aseptic loosening of the tibial component in cemented total knee arthroplasty remains a major concern. We hypothesize that micromotion between the cement and trabeculae leads to increased circulation of interstitial fluid which in turn causes fluid-induced resorption of the trabeculae. Another mechanism for implant loosening is trabecular strain shielding. Using a newly developed experimental setup and digital image correlation ({DIC}) methods we were able to measure micromotion and strains in lab-prepared cement-trabeculae interface specimens (n=4). Finite element ({FE}) models of these specimens were developed to determine whether differences in micromotion and strain in morphologically varying specimens could be simulated accurately. Results showed that the measured micromotion and strains correlated well with {FE} model predictions (r2=0.59–0.85; r2=0.66–0.90). Global specimen strains measured axially matched well with the {FE} model strains (r2=0.87). {FE} model cement strains showed an increasing trend with distance from the cement border. The influence of loss of trabecular connectivity at the specimen edges was studied using our {FE} model results. Micromotion values at the outer edge of the specimens were higher than the specimen interior when considering a very thin outer edge (0.1 mm). When the outer edge thickness was increased to about one trabecular length (0.8 mm), there was a drop in the median and peak values. Using the experimental and modelling approach outlined in this study, we can further study the mechanisms that lead to loss of interlock between cement and trabeculae at the tibial interface.},

In this paper, we propose a volumetric representation (V-rep) for geometric modeling that is based on trimmed B-spline trivariates and introduce its supporting volumetric modeling framework. The framework includes various volumetric model (V-model) construction methods from basic non-singular volumetric primitives to high level constructors, as well as Boolean operations’ support for V-models. A V-model is decomposed into and defined by a complex of volumetric cells (V-cells), each of which can also represent a variety of additional varying fields over it, and hence over the entire V-model. With these capabilities, the proposed framework is able of supporting volumetric {IGA} needs as well as represent and manage heterogeneous materials for {AM}. Further, this framework is also a seamless extension to existing boundary representations (B-reps) common in all contemporary geometric modeling systems, and allows a simple migration of existing B-rep data, tools and algorithms. Examples of volumetric models constructed using the proposed framework are presented.},

The stable method makes use of the vital vertex algorithm to develop a stable space for the Lagrange multipliers together with a novel discontinuous set of basis functions for the multiplier field. The stabilized method, on the other hand, follows a Nitsche type variational approach for three-dimensional surfaces. Algorithmic and implementational details of both methods are provided. Several three-dimensional benchmark problems are studied to compare and contrast the accuracy of the two approaches. The results indicate that both methods yield optimal rates of convergence in various quantities of interest, with the primary differences being in the surface flux. The utility of the domain integral for extracting accurate surface fluxes is demonstrated for both techniques. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The idea is studied in applications to wave scattering and heat transfer problems where significant advantages are noted over the standard finite element method. Although presented within the partition of unity context, the same enrichment idea can also be extended to other enriched methods to deal with heterogeneous materials.

The inhomogeneous inclusions are discretized into small cuboidal elements, each of which is treated as a cuboidal inclusion with initial eigenstrain plus unknown equivalent eigenstrain according to the Equivalent Inclusion Method. All the unknown equivalent eigenstrains are determined by solving a set of simultaneous constitutive equations established for each equivalent cuboidal inclusion. The final solution is obtained by summing up the closed-form solutions for each individual equivalent cuboidal inclusion in an infinite space. The solution evaluation is performed by application of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, which greatly increases the computational efficiency. Finally, the solution is valiyeard by taking Eshelby's analytic solution of an ellipsoidal inhomogeneous inclusion as a benchmark and by the finite element analysis. A few sample results are also given to demonstrate the generality of the solution.

	abstract = {The {FE}-simulation of inhomogeneous structures, such as composite materials, biological tissues or foams, requires the generation of respective finite element meshes. With increasing complexity of the inner architecture of such structures, this becomes a time-consuming and laborious task. Additionally, the risk of forming bad-shaped elements that may lead to ill-conditioned numerical problems grows significantly. A solution to this problem provides the extended finite element method ({XFEM}). Thereby, the interface between different materials is represented by a local enrichment of the displacement approximation. As a consequence of this, the element boundary need not be aligned to the interface. In order to improve the accuracy of the interface approximation, the development of a plane element based on the {XFEM} and quadratic shape functions will be presented. This element allows for the description of curved material interfaces. The computation of the element stiffness matrix requires a numerical integration process that accounts for discontinuous fields. Regarding a linear element formulation, this can be achieved by an adapted triangulation of the element domain. However, in the case of a curved interface this solution is not applicable. Hence, non-uniform rational B-Spline ({NURBS}) surfaces are used to evaluate the integrals numerically. Finally, the results of different examples will show the general properties such as the accuracy of the numerical integration procedure and the convergence behavior of this element formulation.

It is dedicated to gradient discontinuous problems, which cover the case of bimaterials as the main application. We focus on the use of Lagrange multipliers to enforce adherence at the interface, which makes this strategy applicable to cohesive laws or unilateral contact. Convergence then occurs under the condition that a discrete inf-sup condition is passed. A dedicated P1 multiplier space intended for use with P2 displacements is introduced. Analytical proof that it passes the inf-sup condition is presented in the two-dimensional case. Under the assumption that this inf-sup condition holds, a priori error estimates are derived for linear or quadratic elements as functions of the curved interface resolution and of the interpolation properties of the discrete Lagrange multipliers space. The estimates are successfully checked against several numerical experiments: disparities, when they occur, are explained in the literature. Besides, the new multiplier space is able to produce quadratic convergence from P2 displacements and quadratic geometry resolution. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Such conditions, also called embedded Dirichlet conditions, are typically, but not exclusively, encountered when prescribing Dirichlet conditions in the context of the {eXtended} finite element method ({XFEM}). The method's key idea is the use of an additional stress field as the constraining Lagrange multiplier function. The resulting mixed/hybrid formulation is applicable to 1D, 2D and 3D problems. The method does not require stabilization for the Lagrange multiplier unknowns and allows the complete condensation of these unknowns on the element level. Furthermore, only non-zero diagonal-terms are present in the tangent stiffness, which allows the straightforward application of state-of-the-art iterative solvers, like algebraic multigrid ({AMG}) techniques. Within this paper, the method is applied to the linear momentum equation of an elastic continuum and to the transient, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Steady and unsteady benchmark computations show excellent agreement with reference values. The general formulation presented in this paper can also be applied to other continuous field problems.

Yet, enforcing boundary conditions on non-matching meshes is not a straightforward process, especially when prescribing those of Dirichlet type. By combining a type of Generalized Finite Element Method ({GFEM}) with the Lagrange multiplier method, a new technique for the treatment of essential boundary conditions on non-matching meshes is introduced in this manuscript. The new formulation yields a symmetric stiffness matrix and is straightforward to implement. As a result, the methodology makes possible the analysis of problems with the use of simple structured meshes, irrespective of the problem domain boundary. Through the solution of linear elastic problems, we show that the optimal rate of convergence is preserved for piecewise linear finite elements. Yet, the formulation is general and thus it can be extended to other elliptic boundary value problems. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This work addresses computational modeling challenges associated with structures subjected to sharp, local heating, where complex temperature gradients in the materials cause three-dimensional, localized, intense stress and strain variation. Because of the nature of the applied loadings, multiphysics analysis is necessary to accurately predict thermal and mechanical responses. Moreover, bridging spatial scales between localized heating and global responses of the structure is nontrivial. A large global structural model may be necessary to represent detailed geometry alone, and to capture local effects, the traditional approach of pre-designing a mesh requires careful manual effort. These issues often lead to cumbersome and expensive global models for this class of problems. To address them, the authors introduce a generalized {FEM} ({GFEM}) approach for analyzing three-dimensional solid, coupled physics problems exhibiting localized heating and corresponding thermomechanical effects. The capabilities of traditional hp-adaptive {FEM} or {GFEM} as well as the {GFEM} with global–local enrichment functions are extended to one-way coupled thermo-structural problems, providing meshing flexibility at local and global scales while remaining competitive with traditional approaches. The methods are demonstrated on several example problems with localized thermal and mechanical solution features, and accuracy and (parallel) computational efficiency relative to traditional direct modeling approaches are discussed.

	abstract = {A new technique for sharp-interface modeling of dendritic solidification is proposed using a meshfree interface finite element method such that the liquid–solid interface is represented implicitly and allowed to arbitrarily intersect the finite elements. At the interface-embedded elements, meshfree interface points without connectivity are imposed directly at the zero level set while meshfree interpolants are constructed using radial basis functions. This ensures both the partition of unity and the Kronecker delta properties are satisfied allowing for precise and easy imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions at the interface. The constructed meshfree interpolants are also used for solving a variational level set equation based on the Ginzburg–Landau energy functional minimization such that reinitialization is completely eliminated and fast marching algorithms for interfacial velocity extension are not necessary resulting in an efficient algorithm with excellent volume conservation. The meshfree interface finite element method is used for modeling dendritic solidification in a pure melt where it is found suitable in handling the complex interfacial dynamics often encountered in dendritic growth. Mathematical formulation and implementation followed by numerical results and analysis will be presented and discussed. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this contribution, a mortar-type method for the coupling of non-conforming {NURBS} (Non-Uniform Rational B-spline) surface patches is proposed. The connection of non-conforming patches with shared degrees of freedom requires mutual refinement, which propagates throughout the whole patch due to the tensor-product structure of {NURBS} surfaces. Thus, methods to handle non-conforming meshes are essential in {NURBS}-based isogeometric analysis. The main objective of this work is to provide a simple and efficient way to couple the individual patches of complex geometrical models without altering the variational formulation. The deformations of the interface control points of adjacent patches are interrelated with a master-slave relation. This relation is established numerically using the weak form of the equality of mutual deformations along the interface. With the help of this relation, the interface degrees of freedom of the slave patch can be condensated out of the system. A natural connection of the patches is attained without additional terms in the weak form. The proposed method is also applicable for nonlinear computations without further measures. Linear and geometrical nonlinear examples show the high accuracy and robustness of the new method. A comparison to reference results and to computations with the Lagrange multiplier method is given.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the inplane singular elastic field problems of inclusion corners in elastic media by an ad hoc hybrid-stress finite element method. A one-dimensional finite element method-based eigenanalysis is first applied to determine the order of singularity and the angular dependence of the stress and displacement field, which reflects elastic behavior around an inclusion corner. These numerical eigensolutions are subsequently used to develop a super element that simulates the elastic behavior around the inclusion corner. The super element is finally incorporated with standard four-node hybrid-stress elements to constitute an ad hoc hybrid-stress finite element method for the analysis of local singular stress fields arising from inclusion corners. The singular stress field is expressed by generalized stress intensity factors defined at the inclusion corner. The ad hoc finite element method is used to investigate the problem of a single rectangular or diamond inclusion in isotropic materials under longitudinal tension. Comparison with available numerical results shows the present method is an efficient mesh reducer and yields accurate stress distribution in the near-field region. As applications, the present ad hoc finite element method is extended to discuss the inplane singular elastic field problems of a single rectangular or diamond inclusion in anisotropic materials and of two interacting rectangular inclusions in isotropic materials. In the numerical analysis, the generalized stress intensity factors at the inclusion corner are systematically calculated for various material type, stiffness ratio, shape and spacing position of one or two inclusions in a plate subjected to tension and shear loadings.},

To this end, the available X-{FEM} element mass matrix lumping techniques have been identified and assessed. It is shown that all the methods have their own limitations and are not general enough to handle the enrichment functions specifically developed for the elements with material interfaces. Hence, a general element mass matrix lumping technique has been introduced which exactly preserves the kinetic energies of the basic rigid body and enrichment modes. The idea is borrowed from the previously published method for a specific range of enrichment functions and extended to arbitrary enrichments. A closed-form solution for the critical time step of 1D bi-material element is introduced. Furthermore, a pre-processor program is developed to numerically calculate the critical time steps of 2D and 3D X-{FEM} bi-material elements. Finally, the new formula for the lumped mass matrix of the enriched elements is incorporated in an explicit X-{FEM} scheme and the reliability of the method has been demonstrated in a set of bi-material examples which compare well with the {FE} results.},

In order to solve the problem efficiently, we employ a novel multimesh adaptive higher-order finite element method ( h p -{FEM}) based on dynamical meshes and adaptive time step control. We investigate the possibility to approximate the temperature and humidity fields on individual dynamical meshes equipped with mutually independent adaptivity mechanisms.

	abstract = {In this work, we develop a mortar method for the coupling of non-conforming {NURBS} subdomains within a {NURBS} patch that keeps the benefit of using more regular functions. The idea is to use two Lagrange multipliers to match, across the coupling interface, the tractions coming from the discrete displacements in addition to the discrete displacements. It results in a strategy that is suitable with the continuity of the physical solution: when the physical solution is sufficiently smooth, the strategy enables to represent a C 1 behavior; but, when only a C 0 displacement is expected, no additional errors are introduced since only the traction force is continuous and not the whole derivative fields. Lower stress jumps at the coupling interface can then be observed which allows for a better transition of the information. As an application, a non-intrusive algorithm is also built to solve the proposed coupling method, which enables simple and flexible local enrichments of {NURBS} patches without losing the interest of using more regular functions. A range of numerical examples in two-dimensional linear elasticity are carried out along with comparisons with other published {NURBS} coupling techniques to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coupling and its interest when combined to a non-intrusive strategy.},

Adaptively-refined quadrature rules faithfully capture the flow domain geometry in the discrete problem without modifying the non-boundary-fitted finite element mesh. A variational multiscale formulation provides accuracy and robustness in both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. We assess the accuracy of the method by analyzing the flow around an immersed sphere for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We show that quantities of interest such as the drag coefficient, Strouhal number and pressure distribution over the sphere are in very good agreement with reference values obtained from standard boundary-fitted approaches. We place particular emphasis on studying the importance of the geometry resolution in intersected elements. Aligning with the immersogeometric concept, our results show that the faithful representation of the geometry in intersected elements is critical for accurate flow analysis. We demonstrate the potential of our proposed method for high-fidelity industrial scale simulations by performing an aerodynamic analysis of an agricultural tractor.},

They are ideal candiyears for the isogeometric analysis paradigm profiting from the smoothness of the geometry model, and the higher order approximation and higher continuity properties of {NURBS}. To model complex shell structures which need to be assembled from multiple patches, the bending stiffness should be maintained across the patch interfaces. We propose a variationally consistent weak coupling method for thin-walled shell patches. The method overcomes the need for C 1 -continuity along the patch interface to ensure a corresponding geometric continuity in the deformed configuration and a correct transfer of bending moments across the interface. Importantly, it allows a blended coupling of shells based on different mathematical models, e.g. Kirchhoff–Love and solid-like shell models. The proposed approach retains the high level of accuracy of single patch solutions and reveals its potential for authentic multi-patch {NURBS} modeling. We illustrate the good performance of the method for pure Kirchhoff–Love shell models and blended shell models with various examples. The presented approach supports local model refinements where e.g. full 3D stress states are of interest, and further opens the door for the coupling of laminated composites belonging to different lamina theories.},

The idea is to consider the {NURBS} patch to be enriched as the global model. This results in a simple, flexible strategy: first, the global {NURBS} patch remains unchanged, which completely eliminates the need for costly re-parametrization procedures (even if the local domain is expected to evolve); then, easy merging of a linear {NURBS} code with any other existing robust codes suitable for the modelling of complex local behaviour is possible. The price to pay is the number of iterations of the non-intrusive solver but we show that this can be strongly reduced by means of acceleration techniques. The main development for {NURBS} is to be able to handle non-conforming geometries. Only slight changes in the implementation process, including the setting up of suitable quadrature rules for the evaluation of the interface reaction forces, are made in response to this issue. A range of numerical examples in two-dimensional linear elasticity are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology and its significant potential to treat any case of local enrichment in a {NURBS} patch simply.},

	abstract = {One main challenge of the h p -version of the finite element method is the high implementational complexity of the method resulting from the added need of handling hanging nodes appropriately. The multi-level h p -formulation–recently introduced for two-dimensional applications–aims at alleviating these difficulties without compromising the approximation quality. This is achieved by changing from the conventional refine-by-replacement approach to a refine-by-superposition idea. The current work shows that the multi-level h p -approach can be extended naturally to three-dimensional refinement without increasing the complexity of the rule set ensuring linear independence and compatibility of the shape functions. In this way, a three-dimensional h p -refinement scheme is formulated, in which hanging nodes are avoided by definition. This ease of complexity allows for a highly flexible discretization kernel featuring arbitrary irregular meshes and a continuous refinement and coarsening throughout the simulation runtime. Different numerical examples demonstrate that–even in the presence of singularities–this novel refinement scheme yields exponential convergence with respect to both, the number of unknowns and the computational time. It is further shown that the refinement scheme is able to capture complex solution features that demand for three-dimensional refinement patterns. The dynamic discretization properties of the approach are demonstrated by continuously refining and coarsening the mesh during the simulation runtime to keep the refinement zone local to a moving singularity. Finally, it is shown that the high approximation power of the multi-level h p -scheme also carries over to curved geometries common in engineering practice without a significant detrimental effect on the conditioning of the stiffness matrix.},

Any structure of complex geometry is embedded within an extended, regular and fixed Eulerian mesh no matter how the structure is optimized. High-order B-spline shape functions are further implemented to ensure precisions of stress analysis and sensitivity analysis. Meanwhile, level set functions, i.e., implicit functions are used to enable topological changes of the considered structure through smooth boundary variations. Involved parameters rather than the conventional discrete form of {LSF} are directly taken as design variables to facilitate the numerical computing process. To be specific, the {LSF} is constructed by means of R-functions that incorporate cubic splines as implicit functions to offer flexibilities for shape optimization within the framework of fixed mesh, while the compactly supported radial basis functions ({CS}-{RBFs}) are employed as implicit functions for stress constrained topology optimization. It is shown the proposed {FCM}/{LSF} method is a convenient approach that makes it possible to calculate stress and stress sensitivities with high precision. Representative examples of shape and topology optimization with and without stress constraints are solved with success demonstrating the advantages of the {FCM}/{LSF} method.},

	abstract = {Computational models for the personalized analysis of human femurs contain uncertainties in bone material properties and loads, which affect the simulation results. To quantify the influence we developed a probabilistic framework based on polynomial chaos ({PC}) that propagates stochastic input variables through any computational model. We considered a stochastic E–ρ relationship and a stochastic hip contact force, representing realistic variability of experimental data. Their influence on the prediction of principal strains (ϵ1 and ϵ3) was quantified for one human proximal femur, including sensitivity and reliability analysis. Large variabilities in the principal strain predictions were found in the cortical shell of the femoral neck, with coefficients of variation of ≈ 40 \% . Between 60 and 80\% of the variance in ϵ1 and ϵ3 are attributable to the uncertainty in the E–ρ relationship, while ≈ 10 \% are caused by the load magnitude and 5–30\% by the load direction. Principal strain directions were unaffected by material and loading uncertainties. The antero-superior and medial inferior sides of the neck exhibited the largest probabilities for tensile and compression failure, however all were very small ( p f \&lt; 0.001 ). In summary, uncertainty quantification with {PC} has been demonstrated to efficiently and accurately describe the influence of very different stochastic inputs, which increases the credibility and explanatory power of personalized analyses of human proximal femurs.},

We consider the tetrahedral finite cell method ({TetFCM}) and replace its recursive subdivision based integration approach with geometrically accurate quadrature rules that emanate from higher-order geometric parametrizations of cut tetrahedral elements. The element-wise parametrization procedure relies on the identification of the intersection topology and a series of higher-order mappings based on Lagrange polynomials. We demonstrate with several 3D examples that geometrically faithful local parametrization ensures optimal accuracy, while significantly reducing the number of quadrature points with respect to recursive subdivision. On the other hand, we highlight the strength of subdivision quadrature in the context of a patient-specific workflow for the simulation-based performance analysis of coupled bone/implant configurations. In particular, we show that accuracy, flexibility and computational efficiency of the {TetFCM} critically depends on flexibly applying the two different quadrature variants for fuzzy imaging data and sharp boundary representations, respectively.},

	abstract = {In low permeability environments, transport by advection is often neglected based on a Péclet number criterion. Such a criterion usually states that if the Péclet number (Pe) is much smaller than 1, diffusion dominates over advection and transport may be modeled considering diffusion only. Unfortunately, up to 10 different Péclet number definitions exist and for a particular case these different definitions lead to very diverse Péclet number values, differing several orders of magnitude from each other. In this paper, the different Péclet number definitions are therefore evaluated on their ability to determine the relative importance of transport by advection and by diffusion in low permeability environments. This is done by comparing the results of the analytical solution for pure diffusion with the analytical solution for diffusion, advection and dispersion for a large number of different input parameter values. The relation between the different Péclet numbers and the difference between the calculated concentration considering diffusion only and the calculated concentration considering both diffusion and advection is studied. These calculations show that some Péclet number definitions are not well suited to decide whether advection may be neglected in low permeability media.},

	abstract = {The computational efficiency of random field representations with the Karhunen–Loève ({KL}) expansion relies on the solution of a Fredholm integral eigenvalue problem. This contribution compares different methods that solve this problem. Focus is put on methods that apply to arbitrary shaped domains and arbitrary autocovariance functions. These include the Nyström method as well as collocation and Galerkin projection methods. Among the Galerkin methods, we investigate the finite element method ({FEM}) and propose the application of the finite cell method ({FCM}). This method is based on an extension to the {FEM} but avoids mesh generation on domains of complex geometric shape. The {FCM} was originally presented in Parvizian et al. (2007) [17] for the solution of elliptic boundary value problems. As an alternative to the L 2 -projection of the covariance function used in the Galerkin method, H 1 / 2 -projection and discrete projection are investigated. It is shown that the expansion optimal linear estimation ({EOLE}) method proposed in Li and Der Kiureghian (1993) [18] constitutes a special case of the Nyström method. It is found that the {EOLE} method is most efficient for the numerical solution of the {KL} expansion. The {FEM} and the {FCM} are more efficient than the {EOLE} method in evaluating a realization of the random field and, therefore, are suitable for problems in which the time spent in the evaluation of random field realizations has a major contribution to the overall runtime – e.g., in finite element reliability analysis.},

	abstract = {In boundary representation, a geometric object is represented by the union of a ‘topological’ model, which describes the topology of the modelled object, and an ‘embedding’ model, which describes the embedding of the object, for instance in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In recent years, numerous topological models have been developed for boundary representation, and there have been important developments with respect to dimension and orientability. In the main, two types of topological models can be distinguished. ‘Incidence graphs’ are graphs or hypergraphs, where the nodes generally represent the cells of the modelled subdivision (vertex, edge, face, etc.), and the edges represent the adjacency and incidence relations between these cells. ‘Ordered’ models use a single type of basic element (more or less explicitly defined), on which ‘element functions’ act; the cells of the modelled subdivision are implicitly defined in this type of model. In this paper some of the most representative ordered topological models are compared using the concepts of the n-dimensional generalized map and the n-dimensional map. The main result is that ordered topological models are (roughly speaking) equivalent with respect to the class of objects which can be modelled (i.e. with respect to dimension and orientability).},

We show that the resulting polygonal (poly-){FCM} approach retains the optimal rates of convergence if and only if the geometry of the structure is adequately resolved. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it inherits the ability of polygonal finite elements for local mesh refinement and for the construction of transition elements (e.g. conforming quadtree meshes without hanging nodes). These properties along with the performance of the poly-{FCM} are illustrated by means of several benchmark problems for both static and dynamic cases.},

The durability and dimensioning are both influenced by these discontinuities, therefore it is important to take them into account both for the design process and structural simulations. With the advent of fast and high resolution computed tomography, three-dimensional information concerning the location and the geometry of pores can be obtained. Using these data, we propose a fully automated numerical method to evaluate their influence on the mechanical properties. The current paper illustrates the general idea of how to assess such discontinuities based on voxel (combination of the words volume and pixel (picture element)) or surface tessellation language data using high order fictitious domain methods. The developed methodology provides an insight regarding the stress state of the structure and its life span. The results are used to reduce the costs in the casting process by minimising the number of discarded cast parts.},

This self-contained source discusses the theory and implementation of hp-adaptive {FE} methods, focusing on projection-based interpolation and the corresponding hp-adaptive strategy.The book is split into three parts, progressing from simple to more advanced problems. Part I examines the hp elements for the standard 1D model elliptic problem. The author develops the variational formulation and explains the construction of {FE} basis functions. The book then introduces the 1D code (1Dhp) and automatic hp adaptivity. This first part ends with a study of a 1D wave propagation problem. In Part {II}, the book proceeds to 2D elliptic problems, discussing two model problems that are slightly beyond standard-level examples: 3D axisymmetric antenna problem for Maxwell equations (example of a complex-valued, indefinite problem) and 2D elasticity (example of an elliptic system). The author concludes with a presentation on infinite elements - one of the possible tools to solve exterior boundary-value problems. Part {III} focuses on 2D time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The book explains the construction of the hp edge elements and the fundamental de Rham diagram for the whole family of hp discretizations. Next, it explores the differences between the elliptic and Maxwell versions of the 2D code, including automatic hp adaptivity. Finally, the book presents 2D exterior (radiation and scattering) problems and sample solutions using coupled hp finite/infinite elements.In Computing with hp-{ADAPTIVE} {FINITE} {ELEMENTS}, the information provided, including many unpublished details, aids in solving elliptic and Maxwell problems.},

The theory is cast in terms of an evolutive nonlinear sixth-order partial differential equation for the interatomic density that locally minimizes an energy functional with the constraint of mass conservation. Here we propose a new numerical algorithm for the phase field crystal equation that is second-order time-accurate and unconditionally stable with respect to the energy functional. We present several numerical examples in two and three dimensions dealing with crystal growth in a supercooled liquid and crack propagation in a ductile material. These examples show the effectiveness of our new algorithm.},

	shorttitle = {The Finite Cell Method},
	abstract = {The finite cell method is an embedded domain method, which combines the fictitious domain approach with higher-order finite elements, adaptive integration, and weak enforcement of unfitted essential boundary conditions. Its core idea is to use a simple unfitted structured mesh of higher-order basis functions for the approximation of the solution fields, while the geometry is captured by means of adaptive quadrature points. This eliminates the need for boundary conforming meshes that require time-consuming and error-prone mesh generation procedures, and opens the door for a seamless integration of very complex geometric models into finite element analysis. At the same time, the finite cell method achieves full accuracy, i.e. optimal rates of convergence, when the mesh is refined, and exponential rates of convergence, when the polynomial degree is increased. Due to the flexibility of the quadrature based geometry approximation, the finite cell method can operate with almost any geometric model, ranging from boundary representations in computer aided geometric design to voxel representations obtained from medical imaging technologies. In this review article, we first provide a concise introduction to the basics of the finite cell method. We then summarize recent developments of the technology, with particular emphasis on the research topics in which we have been actively involved. These include the finite cell method with B-spline and {NURBS} basis functions, the treatment of geometric nonlinearities for large deformation analysis, the weak enforcement of boundary and coupling conditions, and local refinement schemes. We illustrate the capabilities and advantages of the finite cell method with several challenging examples, e.g. the image-based analysis of foam-like structures, the patient-specific analysis of a human femur bone, the analysis of volumetric structures based on {CAD} boundary representations, and the isogeometric treatment of trimmed {NURBS} surfaces. We conclude our review by briefly discussing some key aspects for the efficient implementation of the finite cell method.},

	abstract = {With Adaptively Weighted ({AW}) numerical integration, for a given set of quadrature nodes, order and domain of integration, the quadrature weights are obtained by solving a system of suitable moment fitting equations in least square sense. The moments in the moment equations are approximated over a simplified domain that is homeomorphic to the original domain, and then are corrected for the deviation from the original domain using shape sensitivity analysis.

In this paper, we demonstrate the application of {AW} integration scheme in the context of the Finite Cell Method which must perform numerical integration over arbitrary domains without meshing. The standard integration technique employed in {FCM} is the characteristic function method that converts the continuous integrand over a complex domain into a discontinuous integrand over a simple (box) domain. Then, well known integrand adaptivity techniques are employed to integrate the resulting discontinuous integrand over the box domain. Although this method is simple to implement, it becomes computationally very expensive for realistic complex 3D domains such as sculptures, bones and engines.

In contrast, in {AW} scheme the quadrature weights directly adapt to the complex geometric domain without the need to making the integrand discontinuous leading to superior computational properties. In this paper, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of {AW} over the characteristic function method as it requires fewer subdivisions and less time to achieve a given accuracy in both two and three dimensions. In addition, {AW} offers a number of advantages including flexibility in the choice of quadrature points and basis functions.},

	abstract = {With Adaptively Weighted ({AW}) numerical integration, for a given set of quadrature nodes, order and domain of integration, the quadrature weights are obtained by solving a system of suitable moment fitting equations in least square sense. The moments in the moment equations are approximated over a simplified domain that is homeomorphic to the original domain, and then are corrected for the deviation from the original domain using shape sensitivity analysis.

In this paper, we demonstrate the application of {AW} integration scheme in the context of the Finite Cell Method which must perform numerical integration over arbitrary domains without meshing. The standard integration technique employed in {FCM} is the characteristic function method that converts the continuous integrand over a complex domain into a discontinuous integrand over a simple (box) domain. Then, well known integrand adaptivity techniques are employed to integrate the resulting discontinuous integrand over the box domain. Although this method is simple to implement, it becomes computationally very expensive for realistic complex 3D domains such as sculptures, bones and engines.

In contrast, in {AW} scheme the quadrature weights directly adapt to the complex geometric domain without the need to making the integrand discontinuous leading to superior computational properties. In this paper, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of {AW} over the characteristic function method as it requires fewer subdivisions and less time to achieve a given accuracy in both two and three dimensions. In addition, {AW} offers a number of advantages including flexibility in the choice of quadrature points and basis functions.},

	url = {http://www.cie.bgu.tum.de/publications/2016_Wassermann_ECCOMAS.pdf},
	abstract = {Modern 3D Computer-Aided-Design ({CAD}) systems use mainly two types of geometric models. Classically, objects are defined by a Boundary Representation (B-Rep), where only the objects surfaces with their corresponding edges and nodes are stored. One disadvantage concerning a numerical simulation is that B-Rep models are not necessarily water-tight. These ’dirty geometries’ cause major difficulties in computational analysis because even basic geometric operations such as point-in-membership tests fail, not to mention meshing as required by classical boundary conforming finite element methods. Alternatively, objects may be represented by Constructive Solid Geometry ({CSG}), which is strongly related to Procedural Modeling ({PM}). In this context, the model is created using Boolean operations on primitives. The modeling process is then either stored as a sequence ({PM}), or as a construction tree ({CSG}). In contrast to B-Rep models, {CSG} models are intrinsically water-tight. To run a finite element simulation on a water-tight {CSG} model, two alternatives are possible: (i) it can either be converted to a B-Rep-model to obtain a finite element mesh or (ii) its implicit description can be used directly by applying an embedded domain approach, like the Finite Cell Method ({FCM}). In this contribution, we present a design-through analysis methodology using {CSG} and {FCM}. A crucial point in {FCM} is a fast and reliable point-in-membership test which can be directly derived from the {CSG} model. We present the outline of the modeling approach, the realization of the point-in-membership test as a sequence of {CSG}-operations, and discuss advantages and limitations on complex models of relevance in mechanical engineering.},

After a crude preliminary computation, the expert system predicts the performance of various mesh and degree combinations and provides the analyst with rational support for his or her decisions about the mesh design.

The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion.

	abstract = {The paper presents an efficient 88 line {MATLAB} code for topology optimization. It has been developed using the 99 line code presented by Sigmund (Struct Multidisc Optim 21(2):120–127, 2001) as a starting point. The original code has been extended by a density filter, and a considerable improvement in efficiency has been achieved, mainly by preallocating arrays and vectorizing loops. A speed improvement with a factor of 100 is obtained for a benchmark example with 7,500 elements. Moreover, the length of the code has been reduced to a mere 88 lines. These improvements have been accomplished without sacrificing the readability of the code. The 88 line code can therefore be considered as a valuable successor to the 99 line code, providing a practical instrument that may help to ease the learning curve for those entering the field of topology optimization. The paper also discusses simple extensions of the basic code to include recent {PDE}-based and black-and-white projection filtering methods. The complete 88 line code is included as an appendix and can be downloaded from the web site www.topopt.dtu.dk.},

To circumvent stiffness overestimation in high-contrast topologies, a length-scale is applied on the solution using filter methods. The relations between stiffness overestimation, the analysis system, and the applied length-scale are examined, while a high-resolution topology is maintained. The computational cost associated with nested topology optimization is reduced significantly compared with the use of first-order finite elements. This reduction is caused by exploiting the decoupling of density and analysis mesh, and by condensing the higher-order modes out of the stiffness matrix. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive density point refinement approach for continuum topology optimization on the basis of an analysis-mesh separated material density field description based on nodal design variables. The Shepard interpolants are used to construct a strictly range-restricted density field over the design domain with the density design variables defined on a density point grid. Since the density points are defined independent of the finite element mesh, it is easy to refine the density point grid without remeshing the finite element model. A refinement criterion is given to identify the gray transitional regions to be adaptively refined in the subsequent optimization iterations. With such a refinement scheme, the topology optimization can start from a relatively coarse density point grid but still yields a desired higher resolution of the structural boundaries in the final design. Because refinements are only performed when and where necessary, this method is able to improve the boundary description quality of the optimal result with much less design variables as compared with the case of global refinement, and therefore can greatly reduce the computational burden involved in the sensitivity analysis and optimization process. Moreover, the percentage of transitional regions in the final solutions can also be reduced. Compared with using a uniformly globally-dense density point arrangement, this approach can achieve similar optimal designs but with much less computational cost. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the present approach.},

The nonlinear structural response, e.g. buckling or plasticity, must be considered in order to generate a reliable design by structural optimization. In the present paper adaptive material topology optimization is extended to elastoplasticity. The objective of the design problem is to maximize the structural ductility which is defined by the integral of the strain energy over a given range of a prescribed displacement. The mass in the design space is prescribed. The design variables are the densities of the finite elements. The optimization problem is solved by a gradient based {OC} algorithm. An elastoplastic von Mises material with linear, isotropic work-hardening/softening for small strains is used. A geometrically adaptive optimization procedure is applied in order to avoid artificial stress singularities and to increase the numerical efficiency of the optimization process. The geometric parametrization of the design model is adapted during the optimization process. Elastoplastic structural analysis is outlined. An efficient algorithm is introduced to determine the gradient of the ductility with respect to the densities of the finite elements. The overall optimization procedure is presented and verified with design problems for plane stress conditions.},

The strategy allows for h - and p -refinement and employs a so-called ghost penalty term to stabilise the cut cells. An effective procedure based on hierarchical subdivision and sub-cell merging, which avoids excessive numbers of quadrature points, is used for the integration of the cut cells. A basic Laplace problem is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cut cell stabilisation and of the penalty-free Nitsche method as well as their impact on accuracy. The methodology is also applied to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, where the {SUPG}/{PSPG} stabilisation is employed. Simulations of the lid-driven cavity flow and the flow around a cylinder at low Reynolds number show the good performance of the methodology. Excessive ill-conditioning of the system matrix is robustly avoided without jeopardising the accuracy at the immersed boundaries or in the field.},

Multilevel representations are defined in terms of a hierarchy of basis functions, reflecting different levels of refinement. When the hierarchical model is constructed by considering an underlying sequence of bases \{Γℓ\}ℓ=0,…,N−1\{Γℓ\}ℓ=0,…,N−1{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}Gamma {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell \}{\textbackslash}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}ell =0,{\textbackslash}ldots ,N-1\} with properties analogous to classical tensor-product B-splines, we can define a set of locally supported basis functions that form a partition of unity and possess the property of coefficient preservation, i.e., they preserve the coefficients of functions represented with respect to one of the bases ΓℓΓℓ{\textbackslash}Gamma {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell \}. Our construction relies on a certain truncation procedure, which eliminates the contributions of functions from finer levels in the hierarchy to coarser level ones. Consequently, the support of the original basis functions defined on coarse grids is possibly reduced according to finer levels in the hierarchy. This truncation mechanism not only decreases the overlapping of basis supports, but it also guarantees strong stability of the construction. In addition to presenting the theory for the general framework, we apply it to hierarchically refined tensor-product spline spaces, under certain reasonable assumptions on the given knot configuration.},

	abstract = {High-order finite elements are commonly compared with linear element formulations showing that, in terms of the relation between computational time and achievable accuracy, linear element formulations are inferior to high-order elements. On the other hand, the finite element community follows the h-version approach due to its simplicity in implementation. This article compares high-order finite elements based on hierarchic shape functions with low-order mixed element formulations using finite strain hyperelasticity. These comparisons are conducted from the point of view of both accuracy and efficiency as well as highly deformed structures. It also investigates improvements to minimize the overall computational effort such as parallelizing the element assemblage procedure, choosing a starting vector estimator for Newton's method, and investigating the Newton-Chord method. The advantages and disadvantages of both finite element approaches are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The (Isogeometric) Finite Cell Method–in which a domain is immersed in a structured background mesh–suffers from conditioning problems when cells with small volume fractions occur. In this contribution, we establish a rigorous scaling relation between the condition number of (I){FCM} system matrices and the smallest cell volume fraction. Ill-conditioning stems either from basis functions being small on cells with small volume fractions, or from basis functions being nearly linearly dependent on such cells. Based on these two sources of ill-conditioning, an algebraic preconditioning technique is developed, which is referred to as Symmetric Incomplete Permuted Inverse Cholesky ({SIPIC}). A detailed numerical investigation of the effectivity of the {SIPIC} preconditioner in improving (I){FCM} condition numbers and in improving the convergence speed and accuracy of iterative solvers is presented for the Poisson problem and for two- and three-dimensional problems in linear elasticity, in which Nitche’s method is applied in either the normal or tangential direction. The accuracy of the preconditioned iterative solver enables mesh convergence studies of the finite cell method.},

The {NeHIFEM} implements a non-isoparametric mapping similar to that introduced in the {NURBS} Enhanced Finite Element Method ({NEFEM}) for the exact geometrical modeling of problems with curved materials interfaces. In this work, we propose a new generalized {NURBS}-enhanced mapping for triangular elements with three curvilinear edges, together with an isoparametric approach for evaluating basis functions in these elements to facilitate the construction of enrichment functions in the {NeHIFEM}. This unique capability allows the implementation of simple structured meshes for creating the computational model, while fully eliminating the geometric discretization error without introducing additional degrees of freedom. A new approach for the construction of higher-order enrichment functions in the {NeHIFEM} is also introduced to accurately capture gradient discontinuities along materials interfaces. Several example problems are presented to shed light on the accuracy and convergence rate of the {NeHIFEM}. We also show the application of this method for simulating the thermal and structural responses of heterogeneous materials with complex microstructures.},

	abstract = {A general method is proposed to couple two subregions analyzed with finite element digital image correlation even when using a mechanical regularization (regularized digital image correlation). A Lagrange multiplier is introduced to stitch both displacements fields in order to recover continuity over the full region of interest. Another interface unknown is introduced to ensure, additionally, the equilibrium of the mechanical models used for regularization. As a first application, the method is used to perform a single measurement from images at two different resolutions. Secondly, the method is also extended to parallel computing in regularized digital image correlation. The problem is formulated at the interface and solved with a Krylov-type algorithm. A dedicated preconditioner is proposed to significantly accelerate convergence. The resulting method is a good candiyear for the analysis of large data sets.
