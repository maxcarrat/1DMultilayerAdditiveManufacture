  abstract = {This paper proposes a generalized finite element method based on the use of parametric solutions as enrichment functions. These parametric solutions are precomputed off-line and stored in memory in the form of a computational vademecum so that they can be used on-line with negligible cost. This renders a more efficient computational method than traditional finite element methods at performing simulations of processes. One key issue of the proposed method is the efficient computation of the parametric enrichments. These are computed and efficiently stored in memory by employing proper generalized decompositions. Although the presented method can be broadly applied, it is particularly well suited in manufacturing processes involving localized physics that depend on many parameters, such as welding. After introducing the vademecum-generalized finite element method formulation, we present some numerical examples related to the simulation of thermal models encountered in welding processes.

  title = {Reduced-basis based {{S-FEM}} and {{G-FEM}} for the efficient simulation of processes involving moving heat sources},
  abstract = {The numerical simulation of manufacturing processes involving moving heat sources such as welding
or surface treatments are of great interest in industry. It allows reducing the design cycle time and
optimizing the process without the need of costly and time consuming test campaigns.
Using traditional finite element methods (FEM) to simulate these processes may lead to solve
systems of an enormous number of degrees of freedom with a high computational cost. This fact has
motivated the research for more efficient solutions to address these problems in recent years,
focusing on one key idea: the large temperature gradients are confined to a relatively small area, near
the heat source, compared to the size of the piece (heat affected zone, HAZ). Thus, simulations with
a local/global approach [1] or a refinement moving mesh technique [2] can be found in the literature.
The latter strategy is implemented in the widely used commercial code SYSWELD.
This paper explores various strategies to increase the efficiency of these simulations using three basic
ingredients: superposition, solution enrichment and reduced-basis. The feasibility of a coupled
formulation between FE and reduced-basis was previously studied in [3-4]. The general scheme of
the proposed procedure is as follows. First, a background coarse FE discretization is established
along the entire piece. Then, a patch that moves with the heat source is superimposed, covering the
HAZ area. At this point, several possibilities can be considered. One option is to introduce a very fine
FE discretization, resulting in the so-called s-version of the FEM [5] (FEM-FEM approach). Another
choice can be to construct a moving reduced-basis in the patch using information from experiments
or previous simulations (FEM-POD approach). Finally, a Generalized Finite Element (G-FEM)
approach can be followed considering an enriched interpolant on the patch area thanks to the
partition of unity property [6]. These three strategies are compared in terms of robustness and
computational cost.},

We show that the p-version of our GFEM is capable of achieving very high accuracy for multiscale problems which may be impossible to solve using the standard FEM. We analyse the effect of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the method namely: (a) The data and the buffer included in the handbook domains, and (b) The accuracy of the numerical construction of the handbook functions. We illustrate the robustness of the method by employing as model problem the Laplacian in a domain with a large number of closely spaced voids. Similar robustness can be expected for problems of heat-conduction and elasticity set in domains with a large number of closely spaced voids, cracks, inclusions, etc. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
